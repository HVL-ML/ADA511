Content, structure, and learning outcome

This course will teach you the science underlying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. With this knowledge you will be ready to:

(1) Exploit new technologies to build the machine-learning algorithms and artificial-intelligence agents of the future, possibly very unlike present-day ones.

(2) Improve existing machine-learning algorithms.

(3) Understand the metrics used to evaluate and compare machine-learning algorithms, and know which is the appropriate metric depending on the situation.

(4) Understand and even calculate the absolute performance limits of existing machine-learning algorithms.

(5) Explain how machine-learning algorithms work the way they do.

(6) Understand, prevent, correct biases and deficiencies in the data used to build these algorithms.

The course is not only theoretical: you will yourself build the code of an optimal-performing machine, use it on simple datasets, and measure and see with your own eyes its improved performance with respect to popular machine-learning algorithms. You will also have the possibility of building more complex optimal-performing machines in a personalized project.


Krav til forkunnskap
Entry requirements

Programming: it is required that you can follow the workflow of a generic program. Proficiency in programming with R or python is an advantage but not a requirement.

Mathematics: the course only requires 1st-year BSc mathematics, in particular:

- solving algebraic equations
- matrix multiplication
- understanding of the integral of a function (without the requirement of being able to solve integrals)

BUT it is necessary that you know these topics without having to go back to your old textbook all the time. These mathematical requirements are not just theoretical: they are necessary to build concrete code to be showcased.
