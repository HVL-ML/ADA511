Innhald og oppbygging
Content and structure

This course will teach you the science underlying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

In particular you will learn the constraints that must be satisfied by the architecture and training procedure of any machine-learning algorithm, in order that the algorithm give optimal and self-consistent results.

More generally you will learn the basic rules that must govern an artificial-intelligence agent in order that its behaviour be rational, logical, and optimal in making decisions. You will also get a glimpse of game theory, strategies, and representation of knowledge bases.

You will learn how to build, at least in principle, an "optimal predictor machine", which is the unbeatable algorithm having the maximal possible performance for a given task. You will see how present-day machine-learning algorithms try to approximate, in different ways, this optimal machine. And together we will explore how new future technologies could be used to build brand-new algorithms that approximate the optimal one even better.

You will yourself build the code of a simple optimal-performing machine, use it on simple datasets, and measure and see with your own eyes its improved performance with respect to popular machine-learning algorithms such as neural networks and random forests. You will also have the possibility of building more complex optimal-performing machines in a personalized project.

An intuitive way of understanding the course is this: Think of the difference between the knowledge possessed by an automotive engineer, as opposed to the knowledge possessed by a car mechanic (although they have knowledge in common, of course). In this course you will acquire the knowledge to become a "data engineer" as opposed to a "data mechanic".

Learning outcome

Kunnskap og generell kompetanse

Upon finishing the course you will know:

• The basic rules and formula that are common to all machine-learning algorithms.

• The metrics and methods used to evaluate and compare machine-learning algorithms, and which is the appropriate metric depending on the situation.

• The basis of knowledge representation for an artificial-intelligence agent.



Ferdigheter
Skills

Upon finishing the course you will be able to:

• Exploit new technologies to build the machine-learning algorithms and artificial-intelligence agents of the future, possibly very unlike present-day ones.

• Improve existing machine-learning algorithms.

• Understand and calculate the absolute performance limits of existing machine-learning algorithms.

• Explain how machine-learning algorithms work the way they do.

• Understand, prevent, correct biases and deficiencies in the data used to build these algorithms.



Krav til forkunnskap
Entry requirements

Programming: it is required that you can follow the workflow of a generic program. Proficiency in programming with R or python is an advantage but not a requirement.

Machine Learning: no technical knowledge of machine-learning algorithms and techniques is necessary; the course will give you a crash course on these. If you already have such technical knowledge, you'll re-approach it from a different perspective.

Mathematics: the course only requires 1st-year BSc mathematics, in particular:

- solving algebraic equations
- matrix multiplication
- understanding of the integral of a function (without the requirement of being able to solve integrals)

BUT it is necessary that you know these topics without having to go back to your old textbook all the time. These mathematical requirements are not just theoretical: they are necessary to build concrete code to be showcased.
