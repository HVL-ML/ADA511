## Quantities

### Quantities, values, domains {#sec-quant-value-dom}

Most decisions and inferences in engineering and data science involve things or properties of real things. We represent them by mathematical objects -- most often, collections of numbers -- with particular mathematical properties and operations. The mathematical properties reflect the kind of activities that we can do with these things. For instance, colours are represented by particular tuples of numbers, and these tuples can be multiplied by some numeric weights and added, to obtain another tuple. This mathematical operation represents the fact that colours can be obtained by mixing other colours in different proportions. Physics and engineering are founded on this approach.

It's difficult to find a general term to denote any instance of such "things" and their mathematical representation, but it's convenient to find one for presenting the general theory without getting bogged down in individual cases. We'll borrow the term [**quantity**]{.blue} from physics and engineering.

We distinguish between a quantity and its [**value**]{.blue}. For instance, a quantity could be "[The temperature at the point with [coordinates](https://www.unavco.org/education/resources/tutorials-and-handouts/tutorials/geoid-gps-receivers.html)\ \ 60.3775029, 5.3869233, 643,\ \ at [time](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/iso-time.html) 1895-10-04T10:03:14Z]{.green}"; and its value could be [$24\,\mathrm{°C}$]{.yellow}.

This distinction is necessary in inference and decision problems, because we may *not* know the value of a particular quantity. We then consider every possible value that quantity could have, and we can assign a probability to each. The set of possible values is called the [**domain**]{.blue} of the quantity. In our temperature example, the domain is the set of all possible temperatures from $0\,\mathrm{K}$ and above.

Another example:

- *quantity*: the image taken by a particular camera at a particular time, represented by a specific collection of numbers (say $128\times128\times3$ integer numbers between $0$ and $255$)
- *values*: one possible value is this: ![](cat_image.png){width=2em} (corresponding to a grid of  $128\times128\times3$ *specific* numbers), another possible value is this: ![](saitama_image.png){width=2em}, and there are many other possible values
- *domain*: the collection of $256^{3\times128\times128} \approx 10^{118 370}$ possible images (corresponding to the collection of possible grids of numeric values)

Other examples of quantities and domains:

1. The distance between two objects in the Solar System at a specific time. The domain could be, say, all values from $0\,\mathrm{m}$ to $6\cdot10^{12}\,\mathrm{m}$ ([Pluto](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/dwarf-planets/pluto)'s average orbital distance).

1. The number of total views of some online video (at a specific time), with a domain, say, from 0 to 20 billions.

1. The force on an object (at a specific time and place). The domain could be, say, 3D vectors with components in $[-100\,\mathrm{N},\,+100\,\mathrm{N}]$.

1. The degree of satisfaction in a customer survey, with five possible values `Not at all satisfied`, `Slightly satisfied`, `Moderately satisfied`, `Very satisfied`, `Extremely satisfied`.

1. The graph representing a particular social network. Individuals are represented by nodes, and different kinds of relationships by directed or undirected links between nodes, possibly with numbers indicating their strength. The domain consists of all possible graphs with, say, $0$ to $10000$ nodes and all possible combinations of links and weights between the nodes.

1. The relationship between the input voltage and output current of an electric component. The domain could be all possible continuous curves from $[0\,\mathrm{V}, 10\,\mathrm{V}]$ to $[0\,\mathrm{A}, 1\,\mathrm{A}]$.

1. A 1-minute audio track recorded by a device with a sampling frequency of 48 kHz. The domain could be all possible 2 880 000 values in $[0,1]$.

1. The subject of an image, with domain of three possible values `cat`, `dog`, `something else`.

1. The [roll, pitch, yaw](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/rocket/rotations.html) of a rocket (at a specific time and place), with domain $(-180°,+180°]\times(-90°,+90°]\times(-180°,+180°]$.

The vague term "data" typically means the values of a collection of quantities.

## {{< fa exclamation-circle >}} Quantity vs variate
In these notes, we agree that a **quantity** has *one, and only one*, value.

We can consider something that changes with time, or with space, or from individual to individual, or from unit to unit. This "something" is then a *collection* of quantities: one for each time, or space, or individual. We call this collection a [**variate**]{.blue}, especially when it refers to individuals or unit; or a [**variable**]{.blue}.

These are just terminological conventions adopted in these notes. Different texts often adopt different terms. What matters is not the terms, but that you have a clear understanding of the difference between the two **notions** that here we call "quantity" and "variate".

### Notation

We shall denote quantities by italic letters, such as $X$ for example. The sentences that appear in decision-making and inferences are therefore often of the kind "the quantity $X$ was observed to have value $x$", where "$x$" stands for a specific value, for instance ![](saitama_image.png){width=2em}. This kind of sentences are often abbreviated like "$X\mo x$".

:::{.callout-warning}

{{< fa exclamation-circle >}} but keep in mind our discussion from [§ @sec-sentence-notation]: we must make clear what that "$=$" means; it could mean "observed", "set", "reported", and so on.

## Basic types of quantities

As the examples above show, quantities and data come in all sorts and with different degrees of complexity. There is no clear-cut divide between different sorts of quantities. The same quantity can moreover be viewed and represented in many different ways, depending on the specific context, problem, purpose, and background information.

It is possible, however, to roughly differentiate between a handful of basic [**types**]{.blue} of quantities, from which more complex types are built. Here is one kind of differentiation that is useful for inference problems about quantities:

### Nominal

A [**nominal**]{.blue} or [**categorical**]{.blue} quantity has a domain with a discrete and usually finite number of values. The values [*are not related by any mathematical property*]{.blue}, and [*do not have any specific order*]{.blue}.

This means that it does not make sense to say, for instance, that some value is "twice" or "1.5 times" another, or "larger" or "later" than another one. Nor does it make sense to "add" two quantities. In particular, [*there is no notion of average for a nominal quantity*]{.blue}.

Examples: the possible breeds of a dog, or the characters of a film.

It is of course possible to represent the values of a nominal quantity with numbers; say `1` for `Dachshund`, `2` for `Labrador`, `3` for `Dalmatian`, and so on. But that doesn't mean that
\
`Dalmatian`${}-{}$`Labrador`${}={}$`Labrador`${}-{}$`Dachshund`
\
or similar nonsense.


### Ordinal

An [**ordinal**]{.blue} quantity has a domain with a discrete and usually finite number of values. The values [*are not related by any mathematical property*]{.blue}, but they [*do have a specific order*]{.blue}.

This means that it does not make sense to say that some value is "twice" or "1.5 times" another, and we cannot "add" two values. But it does make sense to say, for any two values, which one has higher rank, for example "stronger", or "later", "larger", and similar. Also in this case [*there is no notion of average for an ordinal quantity*]{.blue}.

Example: a [pain-intensity scale](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2004.08.007). A patient can say whether some pain is more severe than another, but it isn't clear what pain "twice as severe" as another would mean (although there's a lot of research on more precise quantification of pain). Another example: the "strength of friendship" in a social network. We can say that we have a "stronger friendship" with a person than with another; but it doesn't make sense to say that we are "four times stronger friends" with a person than with another.

It is possible to represent the values of an ordinal quantity with numbers which reflect the *order* of the values. But it's important to keep in mind that differences or averages of such numbers does not make sense. For this reason the use of numbers can be deceptive at times. A less deceptive possibility is to represent ordered values by alphabet letters, for example.

### Binary

A [**binary**]{.blue} or [**dichotomous**]{.blue} quantity has only two possible values. It can be seen as a special case of a nominal or ordinal quantity, but the fact of having only two values lends it some special properties in inference problems. This is why we list it separately.

Obviously it doesn't make much sense to speak of the difference or average of the two values; and their ranking is trivial even if it makes sense.

There's an abundance of examples of binary quantities: yes/no answers, presence/absence of something, and so on.

### Interval

An [**interval**]{.blue} quantity has a domain that can be discrete or continuous, finite or infinite. The values [*do admit some mathematical operations*]{.blue}, at least *convex combination* and *subtraction*. They also admit an ordering.

This means that we can say, at the very least, whether the interval or "distance" between a pair of values is the same, or larger, or smaller than the interval between another pair. For this reason we can also say whether a value is larger than another. We can also take weighted sums of values, called *convex combinations* (but simple *addition* of values may still be meaningless, though).

Owing to these mathematical properties, [**it does make sense to speak of the average for an interval quantity**]{.blue}.

The number of electronic components produced in a year by an assembly line is an example of a discrete interval quantity. The power output of a nuclear plant at a given time is an example of a continuous one.

It is also possible to speak of *ratio* quantities, which are a special case of interval quantities, but we won't have use of this distinction in the present notes.


### How to decide the basic type of a quantity?

To attribute a basic type to a quantity we must ultimately [*check how that quantity is defined, obtained, and used*]{.blue}. In some cases the values of the quantity may give some clue; for example, if we see values "$2.74$", "$8.23$", "$3.01$", then the quantity is probably of the interval kind. But if we see values "$1$", "$2$", "$3$", it's unclear whether the quantity is interval, ordinal, nominal, or maybe of yet some other kind.

The type of a quantity also depends on its use in the specific problem. A quantity of a more complex type can be treated as a simpler type if needed. For instance, the response time of some device is in principle an interval quantity; but in a specific situation we could simply label its values as `slow`, `medium`, `fast`, thus making it an ordinal quantity.

## Other attributes of basic types

It is useful to consider other basic aspects of quantities that are somewhat transversal to "type". These aspects are also important when drawing inferences.

### Discrete vs continuous

Nominal and ordinal quantities have discrete domains. The domain of an interval quantity can be discrete or continuous. In practice all domains are discrete, since we cannot observe, measure, report, or store values with infinite precision. In a modern computer, for example, a real number can "only" take on $2^{64} \approx 20 000 000 000 000 000 000$ possible values. In many situations the available precision is so high that we can consider the quantity as continuous for all practical purposes and use the mathematics of continuous sets -- derivation, integration, and so on -- to our advantage.

### Bounded vs unbounded

Ordinal and interval quantities may have domains with no minimum value, or no maximum value, or neither. Typical terms for these situations are *lower-* or *upper-bounded*, or *left-* or *right-bounded*, and *unbounded*; or similar terms. 

Whether to treat a quantity domain as bounded or unbounded depends on the quantity, the specific problem, and the computational resources. For example, the number of times a link on a webpage has been clicked can in principle be (right-)unbounded. Another example is the distance between two objects: we can consider it unbounded, but in concrete problems might be bounded, say, by the size of a laboratory, or by [Earth](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth)'s circumference, or the [Solar System](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system)'s extension, and so on.

- If you had to set a maximum number of times a web link can be clicked, what number would you choose? Try to find a reasonable number, considering factors such as how fast a person can repeatedly click on a link, how long can a website (or the Earth?) last, and how many people can live in such an extent of time.

- What about the age of a person? What bound would you set, if you had to treat it as a bounded quantity?
:::

### Finite vs infinite

The domain of a discrete quantity can consist of a finite or -- at least in theory -- an infinite number of possible values (the domain of a continuous quantity always has an infinite number of values). A domain can be infinite and yet bounded: consider the numbers in the range $[0,1]$.

Whether to treat a domain as finite or infinite depends on the quantity, the specific problem, and the computational resources. For example, the intensity of a base colour in a pixel of a particular image might really take on 256 discrete steps between $0$ and $1$: [$0, 0.0039215686, 0.0078431373, \dotsc, 1$]{.small}. But in some situations we can treat this domain as practically infinite, with any possible value between $0$ and $1$.

### Rounded

A continuous interval quantity may be rounded, owing to the way it's measured. In this case the quantity could be considered discrete rather than continuous. Rounding can impact the way we do inferences about such a quantity.

![](iris_dataset.png){width=100%}
The *Iris* dataset from its original paper
:::

The famous [*Iris* dataset](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x), for instance, consists of several lengths -- continuous interval quantities -- of parts of flowers. All values are rounded to the millimetre, even if in reality the lengths could have intermediate values, of course. The age of a person is another frequent example of an in-principle continuous quantity which is rounded, say to the year or the month.

In some situations it's important to be aware of rounding, because it can lead to quantities with different unrounded values to have identical rounded ones.

### Censored

The measurement procedure of a quantity may have an artificial lower or upper bound. A clinical thermometer, for instance, could have a maximum reading of $45\,\mathrm{°C}$. If we measure with it the temperature of a $50\,\mathrm{°C}$-hot body, we'll read "$45\,\mathrm{°C}$", not the real temperature.

A quantity with this characteristic is called [**censored**]{.blue}, more specifically *left-censored* or *right-censored* when there's only one artificial bound. The bound is called the *censoring value*.

A censoring value denotes an actual value that could also be greater or less. This is important when we draw inferences about this kind of quantities.
