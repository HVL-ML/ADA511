## Conditional probability distributions {#sec-conditional-probs}

A joint probability distribution quantifies an agent's uncertainty about all the quantities that compose a joint quantity. This means that in general the agent has no sure certainty about any of them (there are of course special cases where probabilities can be $0$ or $1$, but they are not the general case). Suppose that the agent has a joint probability for the quantities $X$ and $Y$, conditional on a state of knowledge $\yI$:

$$ \P({\green X\mo x} \and {\red Y\mo y} \|\yI) $$

<!-- \P(\pr{The quantity \(X\) has value \(x\)} \land  -->
<!-- \pr{The quantity \(Y\) has value \(y\)} -->
<!-- \| \yI) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- ::: -->

Now consider these two situations:

1. the agent acquires knowledge that $X$ has true value $x$, so its state of knowledge has changed;

2. for inference purposes, the agents needs to *hypothetically* assume that the quantity $X$ has value $x$ (even if that might not be the case in reality);

and, in either situation, the agent needs the probability that $Y$ has value $y$. This probability is written, in either situation as

$$
\P({\red Y\mo y} \| {\green X\mo x} \and \yI)
$$

It is usually called a [**conditional probability**]{.blue}. It is somewhat a misnomer, because *all* probabilities are conditional on something. The implicit understanding here is that *new* information has been added to the conditional with respect to some base state of knowledge.

What is the numerical value of the conditional probability above? We simply use the `and`-rule:

$$
\P({\red Y\mo y} \| {\green X\mo x} \and \yI) =
\frac{\P({\green X\mo x} \and {\red Y\mo y} \|\yI)}{\P({\green X\mo x} \| \yI)}
$$

The denominator is the *marginal probability* for $X$, which can also be calculated from the joint distribution as discussed in [ยง @sec-marginal-probs]:

$$
\P({\green X\mo x} \| \yI) = \sum_{\red y} \P({\red Y\mo y} \and {\green X\mo x} \|\yI)
$$

We can thus rewrite the conditional probability as

$$
\P({\red Y\mo y} \| {\green X\mo x} \and \yI) =
\frac{\P({\red Y\mo y} \and {\green X\mo x} \|\yI)}{\sum_{\red y} \P({\red Y\mo y} \and {\green X\mo x} \|\yI)}
$$

## {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise
Consider the next-patient problem with the joint probability of [table @tbl-urgent-arrival]:

1. Calculate the probability that the next patient needs urgent care, knowing that the patient will arrive by helicopter.

2. Compare the conditional probability you just found with the *marginal* probability that the next patient needs urgent care, independently of transportation means (calculated in a previous exercise). Which is higher? Why?

3. Calculate the probability that the next patient arrives by helicopter, knowing that the patient will need urgent care.

4. Compare the conditional probability from 3. with that from 1. Why are they so different? Why is the probability "$\prq{helicopter}\|\prq{urgent}$" so low, when "$\prq{urgent}\|\prq{helicopter}$" is so high instead? find an intuitive explanation.
