## Marginal probability distributions {#sec-marginal-probs}

In some situations an agent has a joint distribution of degrees of belief for the possible values of a joint quantity, but it needs to consider its belief in the value of *one* component quantity alone, *irrespective of what the values for the other components quantities might be*.

Consider for instance the joint probability for the next-patient arrival scenario of [table @tbl-urgent-arrival] from [§ @sec-repr-joint-prob], with joint quantity $(U,T)$. We may be interested in the probability that the next patient will need $\cat{urgent}$ care, *independently of how the patient is transported to the hospital*. This probability can be found, as usual, by analysing the problem in terms of *sentences* and using the [basic rules of inference from § @sec-fundamental].

The sentence of interest is "[The next patient will require urgent care]{.midgrey}", or in symbols

$$U \mo \cat{urgent}$$

which is equivalent to "[The next patient will require urgent care, and will arrive by ambulance, helicopter, or other means]{.midgrey}", or in symbols

$$
U \mo \cat{urgent} \land
(
T \mo \cat{ambulance} \lor
T \mo \cat{helicopter} \lor
T \mo \cat{other}
)
$$

Using the [derived rules of Boolean algebra of § @sec-boolean] we can rewrite this sentence in yet another way:

$$
(U \mo \cat{urgent} \land T \mo \cat{ambulance}) \lor
(U \mo \cat{urgent} \land T \mo \cat{helicopter}) \lor
(U \mo \cat{urgent} \land T \mo \cat{other})
$$


This last sentence is an `or` of *mutually exclusive* sentences. Its probability is therefore given by the `or` rule without the `and` terms  (we now use the comma "$\and$" for `and`):

:::{.column-page-right}
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\P(U \mo \cat{urgent} \| \yi[H])
\\[1ex]
&\quad{}=
\P\bigl[
(U \mo \cat{urgent} \and T \mo \cat{ambulance}) \lor
(U \mo \cat{urgent} \and T \mo \cat{helicopter}) \lor
(U \mo \cat{urgent} \and T \mo \cat{other})
\| \yi[H] \bigr]
\\[1ex]
&\quad{}=\begin{aligned}[t]
&\P(U \mo \cat{urgent} \and T \mo \cat{ambulance} \| \yi[H]) +{}
\\
&\quad\P(U \mo \cat{urgent} \and T \mo \cat{helicopter} \| \yi[H]) +{}
\\
&\quad\P(U \mo \cat{urgent} \and T \mo \cat{other} \| \yi[H])
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

We have found that the probability for a value of the urgency quantity $U$, independently of the value of the transportation quantity $T$, can be calculated by summing all joint probabilities with all possible $T$ values. Using the $\sum$-notation we can write this compactly:

$$
\P(U \mo \cat{urgent} \| \yi[H]) =
\sum_{t}
\P(U \mo \cat{urgent} \and T\mo t \| \yi[H])
$$

where it's understood that the sum index $t$ runs over the values $\set{\cat{ambulance}, \cat{helicopter}, \cat{other}}$.


This is called a [**marginal probability**]{.blue}.

Using the values from [table @tbl-urgent-arrival], calculate:

- the marginal probability that the next patient will need urgent care
- the marginal probability that the next patient will arrive by helicopter

\

Considering now a more abstract case for a bivariate quantity with component quantities $X$ and $Y$, the probability for a specific value of $X$, conditional on some information $\yI$ and  irrespective of what the value of $Y$ might be, is given by

$$
\P({\green X\mo x}\| \yI) = \sum_{\red y} \P({\red Y\mo y} \and {\green X\mo x} \| \yI)
$$

You may notice the similarity with the expression for a *combined probability* from [§ @sec-combined-probs]. Indeed a marginal probability is just a special case of a combined probability: we are combining all probabilities that exhaust the possibilities for the sentence $Y\mo y$.

## Marginal density distributions {#sec-marginal-dens}

In the example of the previous section, suppose now that the quantities $\green X$ and  $\red Y$ are continuous. Then the joint probability is expressed by a density:

$$\p({\red Y\mo y} \and {\green X\mo x} \| \yI)$$

with the usual meaning. The marginal probability density for $\green X$ is still given by a sum, but  this sum occurs over intervals  of values of $\red Y$, intervals with very small widths; as a consequence the sum will have a very large number of terms. To remind ourselves of this fact, which can be very important in some situations, we use a different notation in terms of integrals:

$$
\p({\green X\mo x}\| \yI) = \int_{\red \varUpsilon} \p({\red Y\mo y} \and {\green X\mo x} \| \yI)\, \di{\red y}
$$

where $\red\varUpsilon$ represents the domain of the quantity $\red Y$.

The fact that integrals appear is in some cases extremely useful, because it allows us to use the theory of integration to calculate marginal probabilities quickly and precisely, instead of having to compute sums of a large numbers of small terms -- a procedure that can be computationally expensive and lead to numerical errors owing to underflow or similar phenomena.

## Marginal probabilities and scatter plots {#sec-marginal-scatter}

In the previous chapters we have often discussed scatter plots for representing probability distributions of various kinds: discrete, continuous, joint, mixed, and so on.

One more advantage of the scatter plots for a joint distribution is that it can be quickly modified to represent any marginal, again with a scatter plot; whereas the use of a surface plot would require analytical calculations or approximations thereof.

Consider for instance the joint probability density from [§ @sec-repr-joint-dens], represented by the formula

:::{.column-page-inset-right}
$$
\p(X\mo x \and Y\mo y \| \yI) =
\tfrac{3}{8\,\pi}\, \e^{-\frac{1}{2} (x-1)^2-(y-1)^2}+
\tfrac{3}{64\,\pi}\,\e^{-\frac{1}{32} (x-2)^2-\frac{1}{2} (y-4)^2}+ \tfrac{1}{40\,\pi}\,\e^{-\frac{1}{8} (x-5)^2-\frac{1}{5} (y-2)^2}
$$
:::

and suppose we would like to visualize the marginal density for $X$,\ \ $\p(X\mo x \| \yI)$. In order to represent it with a line plot, we would first have to calculate the integral of the formula above over all possible values of $Y$:

:::{.column-page-inset-right}
$$
\p(X\mo x \| \yI) =
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
\Bigl[
\tfrac{3}{8\,\pi}\, \e^{-\frac{1}{2} (x-1)^2-(y-1)^2}+
\tfrac{3}{64\,\pi}\,\e^{-\frac{1}{32} (x-2)^2-\frac{1}{2} (y-4)^2}+ \tfrac{1}{40\,\pi}\,\e^{-\frac{1}{8} (x-5)^2-\frac{1}{5} (y-2)^2}
\Bigr]
\, \di y
$$
:::

But suppose, instead, that we have stored the points used to represent the density as a scatter plot, as in [fig. @fig-scatterXY]. Each of these points is a pair of coordinates $(x,y)$, representing an $X$-value and a $Y$-value. It turns out that *these same points can be used to make a scatter-plot of the marginal density for $X$*, by considering their $x$-coordinates only. Often we use a subsample (unsystematically chosen) of them, so that the resulting one-dimensional scatter plot doesn't become too congested and difficult to read. 

As an example, here is a scatter plot for the marginal density $\p(X\mo x \| \yI)$ above, obtained by selecting a subset of 400 points from the scatter plot ([fig. @fig-scatterXY]) for $\p(X\mo x \and Y\mo y \| \yI)$; the points are replaced by vertical lines for better visibility:

## {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise
The points for the scatter plot of [fig. @fig-scatterXY] ([§ @sec-repr-joint-dens]) are saved in [this `csv` file](exercise_data/scatterXY_samples.csv). Use them to represent the marginal probability density $\p(Y\mo y \| \yI)$, for the other quantity $Y$, as a scatter plot.

## Uses and pitfalls of marginal probability distributions {#sec-use-pitfall-marginal}

An agent's probability distribution for a multi-dimensional joint quantity is not easily -- or at all -- visualizable. This shortcoming is even worse because, as discussed in [§ @sec-monty-motivation], our intuition often fails us badly in multi-dimensional problems.

Marginal probability distributions for one or two of the component quantities are useful because they offer us a little glimpse of the multi-dimensional "monster". In concrete engineering and data-science problem, when we need to discuss a multi-dimensional distribution it is good practice to visually report at least its one-dimensional marginal distributions.

In the machine-learning literature, one frequent application of this low-dimensional glimpse is for qualitatively assessing whether two multi-dimensional distributions are similar. Their one-dimensional marginals are visually compared and, if they overlap, one hopes (and some works in the literature even conclude) that the multi-dimensional distributions are somewhat similar as well.

\

Unfortunately marginal distributions can also be quite deceiving:

:::{.callout-caution}
## {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise
Here are three different joint probability densities for the joint quantity $(X,Y)$, each density represented by a scatter plot with 200 points. the files containing the coordinates of the scatter-plot points are also given:

**A**. File [`scatterXY_A.csv`](scatterXY_A.csv):\
    ![](scatterXY_A.png){width=90%}

**B**. File [`scatterXY_B.csv`](scatterXY_B.csv):\
    ![](scatterXY_B.png){width=90%}

**C**. File [`scatterXY_C.csv`](scatterXY_C.csv):\
    ![](scatterXY_C.png){width=90%}

\

- For each density, plot the marginal density for the quantity $X$ as a scatter plot. Use the method described in [§ @sec-marginal-scatter]; do not subsample the points.\

    What can you say about the three marginal densities you obtain?

\

- Analogously, but for the marginal densities for $Y$.
