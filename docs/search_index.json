You may say “well, data can be just numbers, they don’t need to be communicated through sentences”. But is that true? I give you this number: “5”. OK it’s a number, but what’s it about? what should you do with it? is that “data”? Instead, if I tell you: “The number of lectures in this course is 5” then I have given you a piece of information, a datum (even if it is actually false). Underlying any piece of information, hypothesis, or datum, there is always a statement – also called sentence or proposition1 – that gives you the meaning and context of that datum. 2.2 Well-posed and ill-posed statements We face problems when the statements that should convey information are not clear. Suppose that an electric-car model consumes 150 Wh/km and has a range of 200 km; a second car model consumes 250 Wh/km and has a range of 600 km. Someone asks you: “which model is better?”. Well, it isn’t clear how you should answer; what does “better” mean? If it refers to consumption, then the first car is “better”. If it refers to range, then the second car is “better”. If it refers to a combination of these two characteristics, or to something else, then you simply can’t answer. Here we have a problem with querying and giving data, because the statement underlying such query is not clear. We say that statement is not well-posed, or that it is ill-posed. This may seem an obvious discussion to you. Yet you’d be surprised by how often unclear statements appear in scientific papers about data engineering! Not seldom we find discussions and disagreements that actually come from unclear underlying statements, that two parties interpret in different ways. As a data engineer, you’ll often have the upper hand if you are on the lookout for ill-posed statements. Whenever you face an important question, or you’re given an important piece of information, or you must provide an important piece of information, always take a little time to examine whether the question or information is actually well-posed. Exercise: give actual paper to analyse These terms are not equivalent in Logic, but we’ll use them as synonyms here.↩ "],["truth-inference-and-probability-inference.html", "3 Truth inference and probability inference 3.1 Truth, falsity, and their consistency 3.2 Inferences without uncertainty: the truth calculus 3.3 Making room for uncertainty:Plausibility, credibility, degree of belief, probability 3.4 Inferences with uncertainty: the probability calculus 3.5 Common points of certain and uncertain inference", " 3 Truth inference and probability inference 3.1 Truth, falsity, and their consistency 3.2 Inferences without uncertainty: the truth calculus 3.3 Making room for uncertainty:Plausibility, credibility, degree of belief, probability 3.4 Inferences with uncertainty: the probability calculus 3.4.1 The Three Fundamental Laws of inference Exercise: Monty-Hall problem &amp; variations Exercise: clinical test &amp; diagnosis 3.4.2 Bayes’s theorem 3.5 Common points of certain and uncertain inference No premises?
