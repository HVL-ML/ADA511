    "text": "4.1 The wide scope and characteristics of inferences\nLet’s see a couple more informal examples of inference problems. For some of them an underlying decision-making problem is also alluded to:\n\nLooking at the weather we try to assess if it’ll rain today, to decide whether to take an umbrella.\nConsidering a patient’s symptoms, test results, and medical history, a clinician tries to assess which disease affects a patient, so as to decide on the optimal treatment.\nLooking at the present game position  the X-player, which moves next, wonders whether placing the next X on the mid-right position leads to a win.\nFrom the current set of camera frames, the computer of a self-driving car needs to assess whether a particular patch of colours in the frames is a person, so as to slow down the car and stop.\nGiven that \\(G=6.67 \\cdot 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-2}\\,kg^{-1}}\\), \\(M = 5.97 \\cdot 10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\) (mass of the Earth), and \\(r = 6.37 \\cdot 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\) (radius of the Earth), a rocket engineer needs to know how much is \\(\\sqrt{2\\,G\\,M/r\\,}\\).\nWe’d like to know whether the rolled die is going to show .\nAn aircraft’s autopilot system needs to assess how much the aircraft’s roll will change if the right wing’s angle of attack is increased by \\(0.1\\,\\mathrm{rad}\\).\nBy looking at the dimensions, shape, texture of a newly dug-out fossil bone, an archaeologist wonders whether it belonged to a Tyrannosaurus rex.\nA voltage test on a newly produced electronic component yields a reading of \\(100\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\). The electronic component turns out to be defective. An engineer wants to assess whether the voltage-test reading could have been \\(100\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\), if the component had not been defective.\nSame as above, but the engineer wants to assess whether the voltage-test reading could have been \\(80\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\), if the component had not been defective.\n\n\n\n\nFrom measurements of the Sun’s energy output and of concentrations of various substances in the Earth’s atmosphere over the past 500 000 years, and of the emission rates of various substances in the years 1900–2022, climatologists and geophysicists try to assess the rate of mean-temperature increase in the years 2023–2100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For the extra curious\n\n\n\nCh. 10 in A Survival Guide to the Misinformation Age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercises\n\n\n\n\nFor each example above, pinpoint what has to be inferred, and also the agent interested in the inference.\nPoint out which of the examples above explicitly give data or information that should be used for the inference.\nFor the examples that do not give explicit data or information, speculate what information could be implicitly assumed. For those that do give explicit data, speculate which other additional information could be implicitly assumed.\nCan any of the inferences above be done perfectly, that is, without any uncertainty, based the data given explicitly or implicitly?\nFind the examples that explicitly involve a decision. In which of them does the decision affect the results of the inference? In which it does not?\nAre any of the inferences “one-time only” – that is, their object or the data on which they are based have never happened before and will never happen again?\nAre any of the inferences based on data and information that come chronologically after the object of the inference?\nAre any of the inferences about something that is actually already known to the agent that’s making the inference?\nAre any of the inferences about something that actually did not happen?\nDo any of the inferences use “data” or “information” that are actually known (within the scenario itself) to be fictive, that is, not real?\n\n\n\nFrom the examples and from your answers to the exercise we observe some very important characteristics of inferences:\n\nSome inferences can be made exactly, that is, without uncertainty: it is possible to say whether the object of the inference is true or false. Other inferences, instead, involve an uncertainty.\nAll inferences are based on some data and information, which may be explicitly expressed or only implicitly understood.\nAn inference can be about something past, but based on present or future data and information: inferences can show all sorts of temporal relations.\nAn inference can be essentially unrepeatable, because it’s about something unrepeatable or based on unrepeatable data and information.\nThe data and information on which an inference is based can actually be unknown; that is, they can be only momentarily contemplated as real. Such an inference is said to be based on hypothetical reasoning.\nThe object of an inference can actually be something already known to be false or not real: the inference tries to assess it in the case that some data or information had been different. Such an inference is said to be based on counterfactual reasoning."

    "text": "4.2 Where are inferences drawn from?\nThis question is far from trivial. In fact it has connections with the earth-shaking development and theorems in the foundations of mathematics of the 1900s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For the extra curious\n\n\n\nMathematics: The Loss of Certainty.\n\n\nThe proper answer to this question will take up the next sections. But a central point can be emphasized now:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInferences can only be drawn from other inferences.\n\n\n\nIn order to draw an inference – calculate a probability – we usually go up a chain: we must first draw other inferences, and for drawing those we must draw yet other inferences, and so on.\nAt some point we must stop at inferences that we take for granted without further proof. These typically concern direct experiences and observations. For instance, you see a tree in front of you, so you can take “there’s a tree here” as a true fact. Yet, notice that the situation is not so clear-cut: how do you know that you aren’t hallucinating, for example, and there’s actually no tree there? That is taken for granted. If you analyse the possibility of hallucination, you realize that you are taking other things for granted, and so on. Probably most philosophical research in the history of humanity has been about grappling with this runaway process – which is also a continuous source of sci-fi films.\n\n\n\n\n\nFilms like The Matrix ultimately draw on the fact that we must take some inferences for granted without further proof.\n\n\nIn logic and mathematical logic, this corresponds to the fact that to prove some theorem, we must always start from some axioms. There are “inferences” – tautologies – that can be drawn without requiring others; but they are all trivial, such as “this component failed early, or it didn’t”. They are of little use in a real problem, although they have a deep theoretical importance."

    "text": "4.3 Basic elements of an inference\nLet us introduce a first element of the mathematical notation for inferences.\nWe have seen that every inference has an “object” (what is to be assessed) and data and information on which it is based. We call proposal1 the object of the inference, and conditional2 what the inference is based upon. We separate them with a vertical bar3  “\\(\\pmb{\\nonscript\\:\\big\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}}\\)”,  which can be pronounced given or conditional on: \\[\n\\textit{[proposal]}\\ \\pmb{\\nonscript\\:\\Big\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}}\\\n\\textit{[conditional]}\n\\]1 Johnson’s (1924) terminology. Keynes (1921) uses “conclusion”. Modern textbooks do not seem to use any specialized term.2 Modern terminology. Other terms used: “evidence”, “premise”, “supposal”.3 Originally a solidus, introduced by Keynes (1921).\nTo calculate the probability for such an inference, we start from those of other inferences. A basic inference process therefore can be schematized like this:\n\n\n\nAgain: terminology doesn’t matter (although it’s useful). What matters is that we understand the properties and uses of these notions.\n\n\n\nThere are now two important tasks ahead of us. First, we want to introduce a flexible and enough general mathematical representation for the objects and the bases of an inference. Second, we want to know what are the rules for making correct inferences."
