## Mechanics and engineers

What is the difference between a *car mechanic* and an *automotive engineer*?

Both have knowledge about cars, but their knowledge domains are different and focus on different goals.

A car mechanic, for instance, can keep your car in top-notch condition; can do different kinds of easy and difficult repairs if problems arise with it; knows whether a particular brand of valve can be used as a replacement for another brand; knows what is the optimal kind of tyres to use in a given season for different brands of cars. But a car mechanic would face difficulties in, say, calculating the theoretical maximum of power output from a new kind of chemical fuel; or designing a new airbag system with increased safety; or calculating the optimal surface curvature of a new kind of spoiler. A car mechanic typically possesses a large amount of specific knowledge, and doesn't need to know in depth the principles of electromechanics and thermochemistry.

Vice versa, an automotive engineer, for instance, can assess how to use the electromechanical properties of a new material in order to design a more efficient and environmentally friendly engine; can calculate how a new material-surface handling would affect air drag and speed; and ultimately can research how to exploit new physical phenomena to build completely new means of transportation. But an automotive engineer could be completely incapable of changing a pipe in your car, or tell you whether you can use a particular brand of lubricant oil. An automotive engineer typically possesses knowledge about the principles of electromagnetism, mechanics, or thermochemistry, and doesn't need to have more specialized kinds of knowledge.

Note that the differences just sketched *do not imply a judgement of value*. Both professions, kinds of knowledge, and goals are necessary, interesting, and couldn't exist without each other. Choice between them is a subjective matter of personal aspirations and passions.

In fact there isn't a clear divide between these two kinds of knowledge, as the simplified descriptions above might instead suggest. There is a continuum between two vague extremities. A car mechanic can have knowledge and insight about new technologies, and an automotive engineer can know how to fix a carburettor.

The two sketches above are meant to expose and emphasize the existence of such a continuum of knowledge and of goals.

## Data mechanics and data engineers

A continuum with two similar extremities can in fact be drawn in [**data science**]{.blue}.

Some data scientists have in-depth knowledge on, for instance, how to optimally store and read large amounts data; what kind of machine-learning algorithm should be used in a given task; which software to use for fine-tuning an algorithm's parameters. Their particular knowledge is fundamental for the working of today's technological infrastructure.

But these data scientists are more "data mechanics" than "data engineers". They would face difficulties, for instance, in

- calculating the theoretical maximal accuracy achievable -- independently of the algorithm used -- in a particular inference problem

- explaining how the fundamental rules of inference and decision-making are implemented in a particular machine-learning algorithm

- identify which inferential and decision-theoretic sub-optimal approximations are made by popular machine-learning algorithms

- exploit new technologies to build new algorithms that do calculations closer to the exact theoretical ones, thereby getting results closer to the theoretical optimum

Because this is a kind of knowledge and skills that they don't need.

A "data engineer", on the other hand, is the data scientist who has this kind of knowledge; and may well not know what software to use to tune the parameters of a particular class of deep networks, or how to best store large amounts of data.

Just like in the case of the automotive industry, both kinds of knowledge, goals, and professions are important and can't exist without each other.

There is a plethora of academic courses, in all kinds of format, that target "data-mechanics" knowledge and goals. Unfortunately, those courses are inadequate to cover "data engineering" goals. Sometimes they even misleadingly present approximations and recipes, only valid for particular situations, as if they were general rules or laws. As an example, if you have some acquaintance with machine learning through a "data mechanics" course, you might be surprised by the following facts:

- [[{{< fa exclamation-circle >}}]{.midgrey}\ Divisions of data into "training set", "validation set", and similar sets, are *not* part of the exact application of the laws of inference and decision-making; in fact, they would lead to sub-optimal results. Rather, such divisions are done as coarse approximations of the exact application.]{.small}

- [[{{< fa exclamation-circle >}}]{.midgrey}\ Cross-validation and similar techniques are *not* part of the exact methods either. They also arise as approximations of the exact methods.]{.small}

- [[{{< fa exclamation-circle >}}]{.midgrey}\ It is possible to calculate, within probable bounds, the maximal accuracy (or other metric) achievable by *any* classification or regression algorithm for a given application.]{.small}

- [[{{< fa exclamation-circle >}}]{.midgrey}\ Some evaluation metrics, such as the [area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUC)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc) have intrinsic flaws and may attribute higher values to worse-performing algorithms.]{.small}


Courses that target "data engineering" knowledge seem to be more rare. One possible reason is that this kind of knowledge is often hidden in courses on probability, statistics, and decision theory, and presented with a language that makes connections with other fields in data science very opaque and confusing. Or worse, in a language that emphasizes connections that are actually superficial and misleading.

We believe that it is important to teach and cultivate the less "mechanics" side of data science. Current advances in computational technology @@

## Goals of this course




<!-- - "Engineering based on data" is just how engineering and science in general have been in the past 400 years or so. Nothing new there. -->

<!-- - The amount of available data has changed. This may lead to a reduction -- or in some cases an increase -- in uncertainty, and therefore to different solutions. -->

<!-- - Luckily the fundamental theory to deal with large amount of data is exactly the same to deal with small amounts. So the foundations haven't changed. -->

<!-- This course makes you acquainted with the foundations. -->

> Many results of science that we readily believe are in fact quite extraordinary claims. Take a moment to reflect on how unbelievable the following propositions would have appeared to a keen and intelligent observer of nature from 500 years ago. The earth is very old, well over 4 billion years of age; it exists in a near-vacuum and revolves around the sun, which is about 150 million kilometers away; in the sun a great deal of energy is produced by nuclear fusion, the same kind of process as the explosion of a hydrogen bomb; all material objects are made up of invisible molecules and atoms, which are in turn made up of elementary particles, all far too small ever to be seen or felt directly; in each cell of a living creature there is a hypercomplex molecule called DNA, which largely determines the shape and functioning of the organism; and so on. Most members of today's educated public subscribing to the "Western" civilization would assent to most of these propositions without hesitation, teach them confidently to their children, and become indignant when some ignorant people question these truths. However, if they were asked to say why they believe these items of scientific common sense, most would be unable to produce any convincing arguments. It may even be that the more basic and firm the belief is, the more stumped we tend to feel in trying to justify it. Such a correlation would indicate that unquestioning belief has served as a substitute for genuine understanding.

> It is neither desirable nor any longer effective to try bullying people into accepting the authority of science. Instead, all members of the educated public can be invited to participate in science, in order to experience the true nature and value of scientific inquiry. This does not mean listening to professional scientists tell condescending stories about how they have discovered wonderful things, which you should believe for reasons that are too difficult for you to understand in real depth and detail. Doing science ought to mean asking your own questions, making your own investigations, and drawing your own conclusions for your own reasons. Of course it will not be feasible to advance the "cutting edge" or "frontier"" of modern science without first acquiring years of specialist training. However, the cutting edge is not all there is to science, nor is it necessarily the most valuable part of science. Questions that have been answered are still worth asking again, so you can understand for yourself how to arrive at the standard answers, and possibly discover new answers or recover forgotten answers that are valuable.
