*Science is built up with facts, as a house is with stones. But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house.*

- Difference between car mechanic and automotive engineer

- "Engineering based on data" is just how engineering and science in general have been in the past 400 years or so. Nothing new there.

- The amount of available data has changed. This may lead to a reduction -- or in some cases an increase -- in uncertainty, and therefore to different solutions.

- Luckily the fundamental theory to deal with large amount of data is exactly the same to deal with small amounts. So the foundations haven't changed.

This course makes you acquainted with the foundations.
