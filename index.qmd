*Science is built up with facts, as a house is with stones. But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house.*

To be written.




- Difference between car mechanic and automotive engineer

- "Engineering based on data" is just how engineering and science in general have been in the past 400 years or so. Nothing new there.

- The amount of available data has changed. This may lead to a reduction -- or in some cases an increase -- in uncertainty, and therefore to different solutions.

- Luckily the fundamental theory to deal with large amount of data is exactly the same to deal with small amounts. So the foundations haven't changed.

This course makes you acquainted with the foundations.



> Many results of science that we readily believe are in fact quite extraordinary claims. Take a moment to reflect on how unbelievable the following propositions would have appeared to a keen and intelligent observer of nature from 500 years ago. The earth is very old, well over 4 billion years of age; it exists in a near-vacuum and revolves around the sun, which is about 150 million kilometers away; in the sun a great deal of energy is produced by nuclear fusion, the same kind of process as the explosion of a hydrogen bomb; all material objects are made up of invisible molecules and atoms, which are in turn made up of elementary particles, all far too small ever to be seen or felt directly; in each cell of a living creature there is a hypercomplex molecule called DNA, which largely determines the shape and functioning of the organism; and so on. Most members of today's educated public subscribing to the "Western" civilization would assent to most of these propositions without hesitation, teach them confidently to their children, and become indignant when some ignorant people question these truths. However, if they were asked to say why they believe these items of scientific common sense, most would be unable to produce any convincing arguments. It may even be that the more basic and firm the belief is, the more stumped we tend to feel in trying to justify it. Such a correlation would indicate that unquestioning belief has served as a substitute for genuine understanding.

> It is neither desirable nor any longer effective to try bullying people into accepting the authority of science. Instead, all members of the educated public can be invited to participate in science, in order to experience the true nature and value of scientific inquiry. This does not mean listening to professional scientists tell condescending stories about how they have discovered wonderful things, which you should believe for reasons that are too difficult for you to understand in real depth and detail. Doing science ought to mean asking your own questions, making your own investigations, and drawing your own conclusions for your own reasons. Of course it will not be feasible to advance the "cutting edge" or "frontier"" of modern science without first acquiring years of specialist training. However, the cutting edge is not all there is to science, nor is it necessarily the most valuable part of science. Questions that have been answered are still worth asking again, so you can understand for yourself how to arrive at the standard answers, and possibly discover new answers or recover forgotten answers that are valuable.
