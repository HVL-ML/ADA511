## Populations with joint variates

The definition of statistical population ([§ @sec-variates-populations]) makes it clear that the quantity associated with each unit can be of arbitrary complexity. In particular it could be a joint quantity ([§ @sec-data-multiv]), that is, a collection of quantities of a simpler type.

As an example, consider the following population, relevant for [glass forensics](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/forensic-science-communications/fsc/april2009/review/2009_04_review01.htm):

- *units:* glass fragments (collected at specific locations)
- *variate:* the joint variate consisting of four simple variates:
    + [**R**efractive **I**ndex](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_26.html#Ch26-S2) of the glass fragment  (interval continuous variate), with domain from $1$ (included) to $+\infty$
	+ weight percent of [**Ca**lcium](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Calcium) in the fragment (interval discrete variate), with domain from $0$ to $100$ in steps of 0.01
	+ weight percent of [**Si**licon](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/14) in the fragment (interval discrete variate), with domain from $0$ to $100$ in steps of 0.01
    + **Type** of glass fragment (nominal variate), with seven possible values `building_windows_float_processed`, `building_windows_non_float_processed`, `vehicle_windows_float_processed`, `vehicle_windows_non_float_processed`, `containers`, `tableware`, `headlamps`

: Glass fragments {#tbl-glass .sm}

The joint variate value for [unit 4]{.yellow}, for instance, is

$$
\textrm{\small RI}\mo 1.52247 \land
\textrm{\small Ca}\mo 9.76 \land
\textrm{\small Si}\mo 70.26 \land
\textrm{\small Type}\mo \cat{headlamps}
$$

## Joint frequencies





## Marginal populations

When a population has a joint variate, we may be interested in only a subset of the simpler variates that constitute the joint one. In the glass-forensics population above, for instance, we might be interested only in the **Ca**lcium and **Type** variates. These two variates together define what we can call a [**marginal population**]{.blue} of the original one. A marginal population has the same units as the original one, but only a subset of the variates of the original. It is a statistical population in its own right.
