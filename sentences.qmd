# Data: use and communication

## Sentences -- or, what is "data"?

What is "data"?

"Data" (from Latin "given") is used more or less in the same sense as "information", and in these notes we'll use the two words as synonyms.

"Data" is often presented as numbers; but it's obviously more than that. I give you this number: "8". Is it "data"? what is it about? what should you do with it? We can hardly call this number a piece of information, since we have no clue what we could do with it. Instead, if I tell you: "_[The number of official planets in the solar system is 8](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/overview)_", then we can say that I've given you data. So "data" is not just numbers. A number is not "data" unless there's some verbal, non-numeric context associated with it -- even if this context is only implicitly understood.

Data can also be completely non-numeric. A clinician saying "_The patient has fully recovered from the disease_" (we imagine to know who's the patient and what was the disease) is giving us a piece of information that we could further use, for instance, to make prognoses about other, similar patients. The clinician's statement surely is "data". It is essentially non-numeric data, even if in some situations we can represent it as "1", say, while "0" would represent "not recovered".

From these two examples, and with some further thought, we realize that "data" -- and in general any piece of information or hypothesis -- can universally be represented and communicated by _sentences_ , also called _statements_ or _propositions_^[These terms are not equivalent in Logic, but sometimes we'll use them as synonyms.]. In some cases we can summarize or represent such sentences as numbers. But the numbers alone, by themselves, are not data.

So our conclusion is that _information_ or _data_ is represented by _sentences_.

Recognizing that data and information are ultimately sentences has important practical consequences:

Clarity and goal-orientation.
: As a data engineer you'll have to acquire information and convey information. Acquiring information is not simply making some measurement or counting something: you must understand _what_ you are measuring and _why_. If you gather data from third parties, you have to ask what exactly the data mean and how they were acquired. In designing and engineering a solution, you'll have to understand what information or outcomes the end user exactly wants. It will often happen that you ask "wait, what do you mean by that?"; this question is not just an unofficial parenthesis in the official data-transfer workflow between you and someone else: it is an integral part of that workflow,  it means that the data has not been completely transferred yet.

## Well-posed and ill-posed sentences

We face problems when the sentences that should convey information and data are not clear. Suppose that an electric-car model [consumes 150 Wh/km](https://ev-database.org/cheatsheet/energy-consumption-electric-car) and [has a range of 200 km](https://ev-database.org/cheatsheet/range-electric-car); a second car model consumes 250 Wh/km and has a range of 600 km. Someone says "I think the second model is better; what do you think?". It isn't clear how we should answer; what does "better" mean? If it refers to consumption, then the first car model is "better". If it refers to range, then the second model is "better". If it refers to a combination of these two characteristics, or to something else, then we simply can't answer. Here we have a problem with querying and giving data, because the sentence underlying such query is not clear.

We say that such sentences are **not well-posed**, or that they are **ill-posed**.

This may seem an obvious discussion to you. Yet you'd be surprised by how often unclear sentences appear in scientific papers about data engineering! Not seldom we find discussions and disagreements that actually come from unclear underlying sentences, that two parties interpret in different ways.

As a data engineer, you'll often have the upper hand if you are on the lookout for ill-posed sentences. Whenever you face an important question, or you're given an important piece of information, or you must provide an important piece of information, _always take a little time to examine whether the question or information is actually well-posed_.
