# Populations & exchangeability
{{< include macros.qmd >}}

To solve *any* inference problem, or to design an AI agent for solving an inference problem, all we have to do in principle is to repeatedly use the [fundamental laws of inference of ยง @sec-fundamental].

In many cases an in-principle application of the inference laws is computationally impossible, however. Approximate calculations and premises are then used, sometimes quite drastic. The approximation used depends on the nature of the inference problem. This is why inference problems are often classified in one way or another, and different solution recipes are presented for the different classes.

For a data-science engineer it is important to keep in mind that these recipes are only approximations, and to keep the principled solution always in sight. Technological advances continually allow us to make computations that were previously impossible -- think of "quantum computers" these days. A truly optimal in-principle solution, preferable to a sub-optimal approximation, can suddenly become accessible -- to those who know it.

\

We shall now introduce a very rough distinction between two very broad classes of inference problems, and then study the principled solution of one of them, and approximations to this solution.

## Exchangeable vs non-exchangeable inferences {#sec-exchangeability}

Consider these two inference problems:

1. Assessing the value that a particular investment fund will have in 100 days from now, given the course of that fund in the past 3650 days (10 years).

2. Assessing the failure status of the next 100th electronic component from an assembly line, given the failure status of the last 1000 electronic components already out of the same assembly line.

## {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise
Discuss:

- Which of the two inferences above seems more difficult? Why?
- Which differences and similarities do you find between the two inferences?
- Answer the same questions, considering two inference problems that are similar but "backwards in time":

    1b. Assessing the value that a particular investment fund had in 3750 days ago, given the course of that fund in the past 3650 days.

    2b. Assessing the failure status of the past 1100th electronic component from an assembly line, given the failure status of the last 1000 electronic components already out of the same assembly line.

The first inference problem seems -- and notoriously is -- more difficult than the second. But why? The first inference is often categorized as "[time-series analysis](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/understanding-statistics/statistical-terms-and-concepts/time-series-data)"
