## "Population" inferences vs time-varying inferences

To solve *any* inference problem, or to design an AI agent for solving an inference problem, all we have to do in principle is to repeatedly use the [fundamental laws of inference of ยง @sec-fundamental].

In many cases an in-principle application of the inference laws is computationally impossible, however. Approximate calculations and premises are then used, sometimes quite drastic. The approximation used depends on the nature of the inference problem. This is why inference problems are often classified in one way or another, and different solution recipes are presented for the different classes.

For a data-science engineer it is important to keep in mind that these recipes are only approximations, and to keep the in-principle solution always in sight. Technological advances continually allow us to make computations that were previously impossible. A truly optimal in-principle solution, preferable to a sub-optimal approximation, can suddenly become accessible -- to those who know it.

A rough distinction can be made between inference problems that involve time-changing situations and information, and those that do not.
