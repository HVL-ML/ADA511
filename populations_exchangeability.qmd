# Populations & exchangeability
{{< include macros.qmd >}}

To solve *any* inference problem, or to design an AI agent for solving an inference problem, all we have to do in principle is to repeatedly use the [fundamental laws of inference of § @sec-fundamental].

In many cases an in-principle application of the inference laws is computationally impossible, however. Approximate calculations and premises are then used, sometimes quite drastic. The approximation used depends on the nature of the inference problem. This is why inference problems are often classified in one way or another, and different solution recipes are presented for the different classes.

For a data-science engineer it is important to keep in mind that these recipes are only approximations, and to keep the principled solution always in sight. Technological advances continually allow us to make computations that were previously impossible -- think of "quantum computers" these days. A truly optimal in-principle solution, preferable to a sub-optimal approximation, can suddenly become accessible -- to those who know it.

\

We shall now introduce a very rough distinction between two very broad classes of inference problems, and then study the principled solution of one of them, and approximations to this solution.

## Exchangeable vs non-exchangeable inferences {#sec-exchangeability}

Consider these two inference problems:

1. In the last 3650 days, the daily change in [closing price](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/closing-price) of a stock was [positive 2774 times]{.green}, and [negative 876 times]{.green} (it is not known which specific days). In which of the next 10 days will the closing-price change be [positive]{.yellow}, and in which [negative]{.yellow}?

2. Among the last 1000 patients visiting a hospital and showing a particular symptom, [760 had pneumonia]{.green} and [280 didn't]{.green}. Which of the next 10 patients with the same symptom will have [pneumonia]{.yellow}, and which will be [pneumonia-free]{.yellow}?

Discuss:

- Which of the two inferences above seems more difficult?...

- ...Why? Speculate on which factors make one inference more difficult than the other.

- Which differences and similarities do you find between the two inferences?

- Which additional information could be important for drawing more precise inferences?

- Which type of quantities appear in the two inferences?

<!-- - Answer the same questions, considering two inference problems that are similar but "backwards in time": -->

<!--     1b. Assessing the value that a particular investment fund had in 3750 days ago, given the course of that fund in the past 3650 days. -->

<!--     2b. Assessing the failure status of the past 1100th electronic component from an assembly line, given the failure status of the last 1000 electronic components already out of the same assembly line. -->

Let's explore which aspects are common or different in the two inference problems.

The amount of available data is different in the two inferences. The first inference, which appears more difficult, is conditional on a larger amount of data (3650 binary quantities) than the second (1000 binary quantities). Yet the data in the first inference seems less informative than the data in the second.

Time appears to be an important aspect of the first inference, which is in fact often categorized as a "[time-series analysis](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/understanding-statistics/statistical-terms-and-concepts/time-series-data)". Yet, the second inference involves or could involve time as well: the patients could arrive at the hospital sequentially. It is the time *ordering* that seems more relevant in the first inference than the second. This is also clear because in the first inference we would prefer to know the (unknown) exact order of positive and negative days, more than the exact order of pneumonia and pneumonia-free patients.

\

An important difference between the two inference problems is revealed by consider the following thought-experiments:

- If the given data were shuffled



. Someone proposes the following exchange of knowns and unknowns in the two inferences, as schematized in the side figure:

1. Instead of assessing the value (unknown) of the fund in 100 days, given the values (known) in the past 3650 days, you can assess the value (unknown) in one of the 3650 days, given the values (known) in the remaining 3649 days and in the day 100 in the future.

2. Instead of assessing the failure status (unknown) of the 100th component from now, given the status (known) of the past 1000 components, you can assess the status (unknown) of one of the 1000 components, given the status (known) of the remaining 999 and of the 100th component from now.

Discuss:

- Does the exchanged inference seem less difficult than the original one, in the first inference problem? And in the second?
- Why?
:::

In the case of the inference problem about the fund value, the exchanged inference seems much easier. We expect known fund values closer to the unknown one to be more informative. In the case of the inference problem about the failure status, the exchanged inference might be slightly easier, but still roughly on the same level of difficulty and the original one.

An inference which remains basically the same if a quantity in the *proposal* is exchanged with a quantity in the *conditional* is called [**exchangeable**]{.blue}.
