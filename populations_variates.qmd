## Collections of identical quantities

In engineering and data science, we often face inference problems involving not just with one quantity (simple, joint, or complex), but collections of quantities. And often the quantities in the collection have a special property: they have the same domain, so they can somehow be considered as copies of one another. Consider the following examples:

- [Stock exchange](https://www.britannica.com/money/topic/stock-exchange-finance)
: We are interested in the daily change in [closing price](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/closing-price) of a stock, during 100 days. Each day the change can be [positive (or zero)]{.green}, or [negative]{.yellow}.

    The daily change on any day can clearly be considered as a binary quantity, say with domain $\set{+, -}$. The daily changes in 100 days are a set of 100 binary quantities with exactly the same domain -- even if each one can have a different value.

- Mars [prospecting](https://www.britannica.com/technology/prospecting-mining)
: Some robot examines 100 similar-sized rocks in a large crater on Mars. Each rock either  [contains [hematite](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast28mar_1)]{.green}, or it [doesn't]{.yellow}.

    The hematite-content of any rock can be considered as a binary quantity, say with domain $\set{\yy, \yn}$. The hematite contents of the 100 rocks are again a set of 100 binary quantities with exactly the same domain -- even if each one can have a different value.

It is easy to think of many other and very diverse examples that are similar to the two above. We shall now try to abstract and generalize this similarity.

## Units and statistical populations

Consider a large collection of entities that are somehow similar to one another. We call these entities [**units**]{.blue}. These units could be, for instance:

- physical objects such as cars, windmills, planets, or rocks from a particular place;
- creatures such as animals of a particular species, or human beings, maybe with something in common such as geographical region; or plants of a particular kind;
- automatons having a particular application;
- software objects such as photos;
- abstract objects such as functions or graphs;
- the rolls of a particular die or the tosses of a particular coin;
- the weather conditions in several days.

These units are similar to one another in that they have some aspect^[The term [*feature*]{.blue} is used in machine learning] common to all. This aspect can present itself in a specific number of different guises, which can be different from unit to unit. For instance, the aspect could be:

- "colour", each unit being, say, [green]{.green}, [blue]{.blue}, or [yellow]{.yellow};
- "mass", each unit having a mass between $0.1\,\mathrm{kg}$ and $10\,\mathrm{kg}$;
- "health condition", each unit (an animal or human in this case) being `healthy` or `ill`; or maybe being affected by one of a specific set of diseases;
- containing something, for instance a particular chemical substance;
- "having a label", each unit having one of the labels `A`, `B`, `C`;
- a complex combination of several simpler aspects like the ones above.

The units could also have additional aspects, which we simply don't consider or can't measure. We'll discuss this possibility later.

From this description it's clear that the aspect of each unit is a *quantity*, as we have defined and discussed in the previous sections. So once the units and their aspect are specified, we have a set of as many quantities as there are units. All these quantities have identical domains.

\

We call a collection so defined a [**statistical population**]{.blue}, or just **population** when there's no ambiguity.

The notion of statistical population is extremely general and encompassing -- so many different things can be thought of as a population -- but requires precision. A statistical population has not been specified until two things are precisely given:

- a way to determine whether something is a unit or not
- a definition of the aspect considered, its possible values, and how it is measured

## {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise
Which of the following descriptions does define a statistical population? explain why it does or does not.

1. People.

2. Electronic components produced in a specific assembly line, since the line became operational until its discontinuation, and measured for their electric resistance, with possible values in $[0\,\mathrm{\Omega}, \infty\,\mathrm{\Omega}]$, and result of a shock test, with possible values $\set{\texttt{\small pass}, \texttt{\small fail}}$.

3. People born in Norway between 1st January 1990 and 31st December 2010.

4. The words contained on all websites of the internet.

5. Rocks, of volume between 1 cm³ and 1 m³, found on the [Schiaparelli crater](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2015/11/On_the_rim_of_Schiaparelli_crater) (as defined by contours on a map), and tested to contain hematite, with possible values $\set{\texttt{\small Y}, \texttt{\small N}}$.

### Infinite populations

In studying a particular class of inference problems, we shall focus on statistical populations with a number of units that is *in principle infinite*, or so large that it can be considered *practically infinite*. It can be considered practically infinite if the number of units we'll use as data or draw inferences about is a very small fraction, say less than 0.1%, of the total number of units.

[This is often the case. Consider for example (as in [§ @sec-quant-value-dom]) the collection of all possible 128 × 128 images with 24-bit [colour depth](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/bit-depth.htm). This collection has $2^{24 \times 128 \times 128} \approx 10^{118 370}$ units. Even if we used 100 billions of such images as data, and wanted to draw inferences on another 100 billions, these would constitute only $10^{-118 357}\,\%$ of the whole collection. This collection is practically infinite.]{.small}

When we use the term "population" it will often be understood that we're speaking about a practically infinite statistical population.
