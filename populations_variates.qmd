## Collections of similar quantities

In engineering and data science, we often face inference problems involving not just with one quantity (simple, joint, or complex), but collections of quantities. And often all quantities in the collection have the same domain, so they can somehow be considered as copies of one another. Consider the following examples:

- [Stock exchange](https://www.britannica.com/money/topic/stock-exchange-finance)
: We are interested in the daily change in [closing price](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/closing-price) of a stock, during 100 days. Each day the change can be [positive (or zero)]{.green}, or [negative]{.yellow}.

    The daily change on any day can clearly be considered as a binary quantity, say with domain $\set{+, -}$. The daily changes in 100 days are a set of 100 binary quantities with exactly the same domain -- even if each one can have a different value.

- Mars [prospecting](https://www.britannica.com/technology/prospecting-mining)
: Some robot examines 100 similar-sized rocks in a large crater on Mars. Each rock either  [contains [hematite](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast28mar_1)]{.green}, or it [doesn't]{.yellow}.

    The hematite-content of any rock can be considered as a binary quantity, say with domain $\set{\yy, \yn}$. The hematite contents of the 100 rocks are again a set of 100 binary quantities with exactly the same domain -- even if each one can have a different value.

It is easy to think of many other and very diverse examples that are similar to the two above. We shall now try to abstract and generalize this similarity.

## Units, variates, statistical populations {#sec-variates-populations}

Consider a large collection of entities that are somehow similar to one another. We call these entities [**units**]{.blue}. These units could be, for instance:

- physical objects such as cars, windmills, planets, or rocks from a particular place;
- creatures such as animals of a particular species, or human beings, maybe with something in common such as geographical region; or plants of a particular kind;
- automatons having a particular application;
- software objects such as photos;
- abstract objects such as functions or graphs;
- the rolls of a particular die or the tosses of a particular coin;
- the weather conditions in several days.

These units are similar to one another in that they have some attribute^[The term [*feature*]{.blue} is used in machine learning] common to all. This attribute can present itself in a specific number of mutually-exclusive guises, which can be different from unit to unit. For instance, the attribute could be:

- "colour", each unit being, say, [green]{.green}, [blue]{.blue}, or [yellow]{.yellow};
- "mass", each unit having a mass between $0.1\,\mathrm{kg}$ and $10\,\mathrm{kg}$;
- "health condition", each unit (an animal or human in this case) being `healthy` or `ill`; or maybe being affected by one of a specific set of diseases;
- containing something, for instance a particular chemical substance;
- "having a label", each unit having one of the labels `A`, `B`, `C`;
- a complex combination of several simpler attributes like the ones above.

The units also have additional attributes (they must, otherwise we wouldn't be able to distinguish each unit from all others), which we simply don't consider or can't measure. We'll discuss this possibility later.

From this description it's clear that the attribute of each unit is a *quantity*, as defined in [§ @sec-quant-value-dom]. Once the units and their attribute are specified, we have a set of as many quantities as there are units. All these quantities have identical domains.

A quantity which is an "attribute" of a set of units is called a [**variate**]{.blue}. So when we speak about a variate it is understood that this is a quantity that appears, replicated, in some set of units.

\

We call a collection of units so defined a [**statistical population**]{.blue}, or just **population** when there's no ambiguity. The number of units is called the [size]{.blue} of the population.

The notion of statistical population is extremely general and encompassing; so many different things can be thought of as a population. In speaking of "data", what is often meant is a particular statistical population. The specification of a population requires precision, especially when it is used to draw inferences, as we shall see later. A statistical population has not truly been specified until two things are precisely given:

- a way to determine whether something is a unit or not: inclusion and exclusion criteria, means of collection, and so on
- a definition of the variate considered, its possible values, and how it is measured

## {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercises
- Which of the following descriptions does define a statistical population? explain why it does or does not.

    1. People.

    2. Electronic components produced in a specific assembly line, since the line became operational until its discontinuation, and measured for their electric resistance, with possible values in $[0\,\mathrm{\Omega}, \infty\,\mathrm{\Omega}]$, and result of a shock test, with possible values $\set{\cat{pass}, \cat{fail}}$.

    3. People born in Norway between 1st January 1990 and 31st December 2010.

    4. The words contained on all websites of the internet.

    5. Rocks, of volume between 1 cm³ and 1 m³, found in the [Schiaparelli crater](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2015/11/On_the_rim_of_Schiaparelli_crater) (as defined by contours on a map), and tested to contain hematite, with possible values $\set{\cat{Y}, \cat{N}}$.


- Browse some [datasets at the UC Irvine Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets). Each dataset is a statistical population. The variate in most of these populations is a joint variate (to be discussed soon), that is, a collection of several variates.

    Examine and discuss the specification of some of those datasets:

    + Is it well-specified what constitutes a "unit"? Are the criteria for including or excluding datapoints, their origin, and so on, well explained?
	+ Are the variates well-defined? Is it explained what they mean, how they were measured, what is their domain, and so on?

## {{< fa exclamation-circle >}} Subtleties in the notion of statistical population

- A statistical population is only a conceptual device to simplify and face some decision or inference problem. There is no objectively-defined population "out there".

    Any entity, object, person, and so on has characteristic that makes it completely unique (say, its space-time coordinates), otherwise we wouldn't be able to distinguish it from others. From this point of view any entity is just be a one-member population in itself. If we consider two or more entities as being "similar" and belonging to the same population, it's because we have decided to disregard some characteristics and focus on some others. This decision is arbitrary, a matter of convention, and depends on the specific inference and decision problem.
	
	To "test" whether an entity belong to a given population, means to check if that entity satisfies the agreed-upon definition of that population.

- Any physical entity, object, person, etc. can represent different units in different and even non-overlapping statistical populations. For instance, a 100 cm³ rock found in the Schiaparelli crater on Mars could be a unit in these populations:

    a. Rocks, of volume between 1 cm³ and 1 m³, found in the Schiaparelli crater and tested for hematite
	b. Rocks, of volume between 10 cm³ and 200 cm³, found in the Schiaparelli crater and tested for hematite
	c. Rocks, of volume between 10 cm³ and 200 m³, found in any crater on any planet of the solar system, and tested for hematite
    d. Rocks, of volume between 1 cm³ and 1 m³, found in the Schiaparelli crater and measured for the magnitude of their [magnetic field](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_34.html).
	
	Populations a. b. c. above have the same variate but differ in their definition of "unit". Populations a. and d. have the same definition of unit but different variates. Population b. is a subset of population a.: they have the same variate, and any unit in b. is also a unit in a. Populations a. and c. have some overlap: they have the same variate, and some units of a. are also units of c., and vice versa.

## Infinite populations {#sec-infinite-populations}

In studying a particular class of inference problems we shall focus on statistical populations with a number of units that is *in principle infinite*, or so large that it can be considered *practically infinite*. "Practically" means that the if the number of units we'll use as data or draw inferences about is a very small fraction, say less than 0.1%, of the total population size.

[This is often the case. Consider for example (as in [§ @sec-quant-value-dom]) the collection of all possible 128 × 128 images with 24-bit [colour depth](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/bit-depth.htm). This collection has $2^{24 \times 128 \times 128} \approx 10^{118 370}$ units. Even if we used 100 billions of such images as data, and wanted to draw inferences on another 100 billions, these would constitute only $10^{-118 357}\,\%$ of the whole collection. This collection is practically infinite.]{.small}

When we use the term "population" it will often be understood that we're speaking about a practically infinite statistical population.


## Populations with joint variates

The definition of statistical population ([§ @sec-variates-populations]) makes it clear that the quantity associated with each unit can be of arbitrary complexity. In particular it could be a joint quantity ([§ @sec-data-multiv]), that is, a collection of quantities of a simpler type.

As an example, consider the following population, relevant for [glass forensics](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/forensic-science-communications/fsc/april2009/review/2009_04_review01.htm):

- *units:* glass fragments (collected at specific locations)
- *variate:* the joint variate $(\textrm{\small RI}, \textrm{\small Ca}, \textrm{\small Si}, \textrm{\small Type})$ consisting of four simple variates:
    + [**R**efractive **I**ndex](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_26.html#Ch26-S2) of the glass fragment  (interval continuous variate), with domain from $1$ (included) to $+\infty$
	+ weight percent of [**Ca**lcium](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Calcium) in the fragment (interval discrete variate), with domain from $0$ to $100$ in steps of 0.01
	+ weight percent of [**Si**licon](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/14) in the fragment (interval discrete variate), with domain from $0$ to $100$ in steps of 0.01
    + **Type** of glass fragment (nominal variate), with seven possible values `building_windows_float_processed`, `building_windows_non_float_processed`, `vehicle_windows_float_processed`, `vehicle_windows_non_float_processed`, `containers`, `tableware`, `headlamps`


| [unit]{.yellow} |         RI  |       Ca  |       Si  |                                   Type   |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------------------------------------:|
|   [1]{.yellow}  |  $1.51888$  |   $9.95$  |  $72.50$  |                             `tableware`  |
|   [2]{.yellow}  |  $1.51556$  |   $9.41$  |  $73.23$  |                             `headlamps`  |
|   [3]{.yellow}  |  $1.51645$  |   $8.08$  |  $72.65$  |  `building_windows_non_float_processed`  |
|   [4]{.yellow}  |  $1.52247$  |   $9.76$  |  $70.26$  |                             `headlamps`  |
|   [5]{.yellow}  |  $1.51909$  |   $8.78$  |  $71.81$  |      `building_windows_float_processed`  |
|   [6]{.yellow}  |  $1.51590$  |   $8.22$  |  $73.10$  |  `building_windows_non_float_processed`  |
|   [7]{.yellow}  |  $1.51610$  |   $8.32$  |  $72.69$  |       `vehicle_windows_float_processed`  |
|   [8]{.yellow}  |  $1.51673$  |   $8.03$  |  $72.53$  |  `building_windows_non_float_processed`  |
|   [9]{.yellow}  |  $1.51915$  |  $10.09$  |  $72.69$  |                            `containers`  |
|  [10]{.yellow}  |  $1.51651$  |   $9.76$  |  $73.61$  |                             `headlamps`  |
: Glass fragments {#tbl-glass .sm}

The joint-variate value for [unit 4]{.yellow}, for instance, is

$$
\textrm{\small RI}_{\yellow4}\mo 1.52247 \land
\textrm{\small Ca}_{\yellow4}\mo 9.76 \land
\textrm{\small Si}_{\yellow4}\mo 70.26 \land
\textrm{\small Type}_{\yellow4}\mo \cat{headlamps}
$$

The units' IDs don't need to be consecutive numbers; in fact they don't even need to be numbers: any label that completely distinguishes all units will do.

### Joint frequencies

The frequency distribution for the joint variate of the population above gives the frequencies of all possible combinations of variate values. In this population, ten joint values appear each only once, and the remaining values never appear; this is because of the population's small size and the large number of possible variate values. Denoting by $f$ the frequency distribution, we have for example^[For the continuous variate $\textrm{\small RI}$, the frequency refers to a small range around the value; see the discussion in (§ @sec-prob-densities). In the present case the range seems to be $\pm 0.000 01$]

$$\begin{aligned}
&f(\textrm{\small RI}\mo 1.51651 ,
\textrm{\small Ca}\mo  9.76,
\textrm{\small Si}\mo 73.61 ,
\textrm{\small Type}\mo \cat{headlamps}
) = \frac{1}{10}
\\
&f(\textrm{\small RI}\mo 1.0 ,
\textrm{\small Ca}\mo 50.00 ,
\textrm{\small Si}\mo 50.00 ,
\textrm{\small Type}\mo \cat{tableware}
) = 0
\end{aligned}$$


## Marginal populations

When a population has a joint variate, we may be interested in only a subset of the simpler variates that constitute the joint one. In the glass-forensics population above, for instance, we might be interested only in the **Ca**lcium and **Type** variates. These two variates together are called [**marginal variates**]{.blue} and define what we can call a [**marginal population**]{.blue} of the original one. A marginal population has the same units as the original one, but only a subset of the variates of the original. It is a statistical population in its own right.

The notion of "marginalization" is a relative notion. Any population can often be considered as the marginal of a population with the same units but additional attributes.

## Marginal frequencies

The [**marginal frequency**]{.blue} distribution for the marginal population is obtained from the original frequency distribution by summing over the values of the discarded variates, similarly to marginal probabilities (§ @sec-marginal-probs). Considering the $(\textrm{\small Ca}, \textrm{\small Type})$ marginal population, we obtain for example

$$\begin{aligned}
&f(\textrm{\small Ca}\mo  9.76,
\textrm{\small Type}\mo \cat{headlamps}
) = \frac{2}{10}
&f(\textrm{\small Ca}\mo  10.09,
\textrm{\small Type}\mo \cat{containers}
) = \frac{1}{10}
&f(\textrm{\small Ca}\mo 50.00 ,
\textrm{\small Type}\mo \cat{tableware}
) = 0
\end{aligned}$$
