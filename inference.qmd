# What is an inference?
{{< include macros.qmd >}}

In the assembly-line decision problem of [§ @sec-intro], the probability of early failure (and that of late failure), in view of the test results, was very important in determining the optimal decision. If the probability had been $5\%$ instead of $10\%$, the optimal decision would have been different. In that scenario the probabilities of the outcomes in view of the test results were already given. In real decision problems, however, probabilities almost always need to be calculated, and their calculation can be the most time- and resource-demanding step in solving a decision problem.

We'll loosely refer to problems of calculating probabilities as "*inference* problems", and to their calculation as "drawing an inference". Drawing inferences is very often a goal or need in itself, with no underlying decision process. 


## The wide scope and characteristics of inferences {#sec-inference-scenarios}

Let's see a couple more informal examples of inference problems. For some of them an underlying decision problem is also alluded to:

A.  Looking at the weather we try to assess if it'll rain today, to decide whether to take an umbrella.

B.  Considering a patient's symptoms, test results, and medical history, a clinician tries to assess which disease affects a patient, so as to decide on the optimal treatment.

C.  Looking at the present game position ![](XsOs.png){width=10%} the X-player, which moves next, wonders whether placing the next [**X**]{style="color:#CA5556"} on the mid-right position leads to a win.

D.  From the current set of camera frames, the computer of a self-driving car needs to assess whether a particular patch of colours in the frames is a person, so as to slow down the car and stop.

E.  Given that [$G=6.67 \cdot 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{m^3\,s^{-2}\,kg^{-1}}$,]{.together} $M = 5.97 \cdot 10^{24}\,\mathrm{kg}$ (mass of the Earth), and $r = 6.37 \cdot 10^{6}\,\mathrm{m}$ (radius of the Earth), [a rocket engineer needs to know](http://nasaphysics.cet.edu/escape-velocity.html)  how much is [$\sqrt{2\,G\,M/r\,}$.]{.together}

F.  We'd like to know whether the rolled die is going to show {{< fa dice-six >}}.

G.  An [aircraft's autopilot system](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/a-i-in-the-cockpit) needs to assess how much the aircraft's [roll](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/VirtualAero/BottleRocket/airplane/roll.html) will change if the right wing's [angle of attack](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/VirtualAero/BottleRocket/airplane/incline.html) is increased by $0.1\,\mathrm{rad}$.

H.  By looking at the dimensions, shape, texture of a newly dug-out fossil bone, an archaeologist wonders whether it belonged to a Tyrannosaurus rex.

I.  A voltage test on a newly produced electronic component yields a reading of $100\,\mathrm{mV}$. The electronic component turns out to be defective. An engineer wants to assess whether the voltage-test reading could have been $100\,\mathrm{mV}$, if the component had not been defective.

J.  Same as above, but the engineer wants to assess whether the voltage-test reading could have been $80\,\mathrm{mV}$, if the component had not been defective.

K.  From measurements of the Sun's energy output and of concentrations of various substances in the Earth's atmosphere over the past 500 000 years, and of the emission rates of various substances in the years 1900--2022, climatologists and geophysicists try to assess the rate of mean-temperature increase in the years 2023--2100.

## {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercises
@. For each example above, pinpoint what has to be inferred, and also the *agent* interested in the inference.

@. Point out which of the examples above *explicitly* give data or information that should be used for the inference.

@. For the examples that do not give explicit data or information, speculate what information could be implicitly assumed. For those that do give explicit data, speculate which other additional information could be implicitly assumed.

@. Can any of the inferences above be done perfectly, that is, without any uncertainty, based the data given explicitly or implicitly?

@. Find the examples that explicitly involve a decision. In which of them does the decision affect the results of the inference? In which it does not?

@. Are any of the inferences "*one-time only*" -- that is, their object or the data on which they are based have never happened before and will never happen again?

@. Are any of the inferences based on data and information that come chronologically *after* the object of the inference?

@. Are any of the inferences about something that is actually already known to the agent that's making the inference?

@. Are any of the inferences about something that actually did not happen?

@. Do any of the inferences use "data" or "information" that are actually known (within the scenario itself) to be fictive, that is, *not* real?

From the examples and from your answers to the exercise we observe some very important characteristics of inferences:

- Some inferences can be made exactly, that is, [*without uncertainty*]{.blue}: it is possible to say whether the object of the inference is true or false. Other inferences, instead, involve an uncertainty.

- [*All inferences are based on some data and information*]{.blue}, which may be explicitly expressed or only implicitly understood.

- An inference can be about something *past*, but based on *present or future* data and information: inferences can show  [*all sorts of temporal relations*]{.blue}. 

- An inference can be [*essentially unrepeatable*]{.blue}, because it's about something unrepeatable or based on unrepeatable data and information.

- The data and information on which an inference is based can actually be unknown; that is, they can be only momentarily contemplated as real. Such an inference is said to be based on [**hypothetical reasoning**]{.blue}.

- The object of an inference can actually be something already known to be false or not real: the inference tries to assess it in the case that some data or information had been different. Such an inference is said to be based on [**counterfactual reasoning**]{.blue}.


## Basic elements of an inference

Let us already introduce the basic mathematical notation for inferences. We have seen that every inference has an "object" (what is to be assessed) and data and information on which it is based. We call  [**proposal**]{.blue} the object of the inference, and [**conditional**]{.blue} what the inference is based upon. We separate them with a vertical bar\ \ [" $\pmb{\|[\big]}$" ,]{.together}\ \ which can be pronounced *given* or *conditional on*:
$$
\textit{[proposal]}\ \pmb{\|[\Big]}\ 
\textit{[conditional]}
$$

There are now two important tasks ahead of us. First, we want to introduce a flexible and enough general mathematical representation for the objects and the bases of an inference. Second, we want to know what are the rules for making correct inferences.
