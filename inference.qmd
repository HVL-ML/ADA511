# Inference

## What is inference?

The first core problem in all data-driven engineering applications -- and in daily life too -- is that _we would like to know something we don't_. In other words, we'd like to have more information. We may wish to acquire information out of simple curiosity, or we may need it for some specific engineering reason or goal, as we'll discuss later. Examples:

1. We'd like to know whether it'll rain today, so we can decide whether to get an umbrella or rain clothes.

<!-- * We'd like to know the number of the winning lottery ticket (if we can manage to buy that number), so we can buy that Lamborghini. -->

2. A clinician would like to know which disease affects a patient, so as to decide for the optimal treatment.

3. The X-player of this game of Xs & Os: ![](XsOs.png){width=5%}<br>needs to know where put the next [**X**]{style="color:#CA5556"} in order to win.

4. The computer of a self-driving car needs to know whether a particular patch of colours in the visual field is a person, so as to slow down the car and stop.

5. A rocket engineer [needs to know how much is $\sqrt{2\,G\,M\,r}$](http://nasaphysics.cet.edu/escape-velocity.html), where $G=6.67 \cdot 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{m^3\,s^{-2}\,kg^{-1}}$, and $M$ and $r$ are the mass and radius of the Earth, in order to launch a rocket to the Moon.

6. We'd like to know whether the coin will come down heads, so we can win a bet.

7. An [aircraft's autopilot system](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/a-i-in-the-cockpit) needs to predict how much the [aircraft's roll](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/VirtualAero/BottleRocket/airplane/roll.html) will change by increasing the right wing's [angle of attack](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/VirtualAero/BottleRocket/airplane/incline.html) by 0.1 rad.

8. An archaeologist would like to know whether the fossil bone just dug out belonged to a Tyrannosaurus rex.

8. An automated system in an assembly line needs to predict whether an electric component of a widget will fail within the next two years.
