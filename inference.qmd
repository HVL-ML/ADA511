## What is inference?

The first core problem in all data-driven engineering applications -- and in daily life too -- is to *draw inferences*, that is, acquire information. We may wish to acquire information out of simple curiosity, or for some specific engineering reason or goal, as we'll discuss later. Examples:

1. We'd like to know whether it'll rain today, so we can decide whether to get an umbrella or rain clothes.

<!-- * We'd like to know the number of the winning lottery ticket (if we can manage to buy that number), so we can buy that Lamborghini. -->

2. A clinician would like to know which disease affects a patient, so as to decide for the optimal treatment.

3. The X-player of this game of Xs & Os: ![](XsOs.png){width=5%} needs to know where put the next [**X**]{style="color:#CA5556"} in order to win.

4. The computer of a self-driving car needs to know whether a particular patch of colours in the visual field is a person, so as to slow down the car and stop.

5. In order to launch a rocket to the Moon, a rocket engineer needs to know, within two significant digits, [how much is the velocity $\sqrt{2\,G\,M/r\,}$](http://nasaphysics.cet.edu/escape-velocity.html), where $G=6.67 \cdot 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{m^3\,s^{-2}\,kg^{-1}}$, and $M = 5.97 \cdot 10^{24}\,\mathrm{kg}$ and $r = 6.37 \cdot 10^{6}\,\mathrm{m}$ are the mass and radius of the Earth.

6. We'd like to know whether the rolled die will show {{< fa dice-six >}}, so we can win a bet.

7. An [aircraft's autopilot system](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/a-i-in-the-cockpit) needs to predict how much the [aircraft's roll](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/VirtualAero/BottleRocket/airplane/roll.html) will change by increasing the right wing's [angle of attack](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/VirtualAero/BottleRocket/airplane/incline.html) by 0.1 rad.

8. An archaeologist would like to know whether the fossil bone just dug out belonged to a Tyrannosaurus rex.

9. An automated system in an assembly line needs to predict whether an electric component of a widget will fail within the next two years.


Note how each of these inferences boils down to determining whether some sentences are true or false. In example 1. we want to know whether the sentence $\pr{It rains today}$ is true or not. In example 2. the clinician wants to know which of the sentences $\pr{The patient has pneumonia}$, $\pr{The patient has asthma}$, $\pr{The patient has bronchitis}$, and so on, are true (several can be true at the same time). In example 5. the rocket engineer wants to know which among the sentences $\pr{The velocity is 0.010\,m/s}$, $\pr{The velocity is 0.011\,m/s}$, ..., $\pr{The velocity is 130\,m/s}$, and so on, is true. The sentences that underlie an inference can be extremely many and complex, and yet we  must have an idea of what they are (otherwise, do we really know what our inference is about?).

## Certain and uncertain inference

The example inferences above present very different levels of difficulty.

Inferences 3. and 5. are special because they can actually be drawn *exactly*, that is, we really find out which of their underlying sentences are true and false. In example 3. it is trivial that putting the next [**X**]{style="color:#CA5556"} in the mid-right slot makes the X-player win. In example 5. a couple of mathematical operations show that the sentence $\pr{The velocity is 11\,km/s}$ is true. When we can obtain the data we want from the data we have by using "only"^["Only" in quotation marks because the logical analysis and operations leading to the answer can still be computationally very expensive.] logic and mathematical operations, our inference is *certain*, also called a "deduction"; in these notes we shall call it a *truth inference*. But every deduction can be basically drawn by repeatedly applying the rules of logic.

The other example inferences cannot be drawn exactly, in the sense that we cannot know for sure whether all their underlying sentences are true or false. But this doesn't mean that we cannot say anything whatsoever. In example 6. we consider the sentence $\pr{The die shows six pips}$ to be more likely false than true. In example 2. the clinician might be quite sure about the disease, after observing the symptoms. On the other hand, in example 1. we might really have no clue whether $\pr{It rains today}$ will turn out to be true or false. These inferences are *uncertain*. Certain inferences can be considered as a limit case of uncertain ones, in which the uncertainty vanishes or is extremely small.

To draw certain inferences, we follow the rules of Logic. What rules do we follow to draw uncertain inferences?
