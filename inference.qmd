# Inference

## What is inference?

The first core problem in all data-driven engineering applications -- and in daily life too -- is that _we would like to know something we don't_. In other words, we'd like to acquire information. We may wish to acquire information out of simple curiosity, or we may need it for some specific engineering reason or goal, as we'll discuss later. Examples:

1) We'd like to know whether it'll rain today, so we can decide whether to get an umbrella or rain clothes.

<!-- * We'd like to know the number of the winning lottery ticket (if we can manage to buy that number), so we can buy that Lamborghini. -->

2) A clinician would like to know which disease affects a patient, so as to decide for the optimal treatment.

3) The X-player of this game of Xs & Os: ![](XsOs.png){width=5%} needs to know where put the next [**X**]{style="color:#CA5556"} in order to win.

4) The computer of a self-driving car needs to know whether a particular patch of colours in the visual field is a person, so as to slow down the car and stop.

5) A rocket engineer needs to know, within two significant digits, [how much is the velocity $\sqrt{2\,G\,M/r\,}$](http://nasaphysics.cet.edu/escape-velocity.html), where $G=6.67 \cdot 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{m^3\,s^{-2}\,kg^{-1}}$, and $M = 5.97 \cdot 10^{24}\,\mathrm{kg}$ and $r = 6.37 \cdot 10^{6}\,\mathrm{m}$ are the mass and radius of the Earth, in order to launch a rocket to the Moon.

6) We'd like to know whether the coin will come down heads, so we can win a bet.

7) An [aircraft's autopilot system](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/a-i-in-the-cockpit) needs to predict how much the [aircraft's roll](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/VirtualAero/BottleRocket/airplane/roll.html) will change by increasing the right wing's [angle of attack](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/VirtualAero/BottleRocket/airplane/incline.html) by 0.1 rad.

8) An archaeologist would like to know whether the fossil bone just dug out belonged to a Tyrannosaurus rex.

9) An automated system in an assembly line needs to predict whether an electric component of a widget will fail within the next two years.

Note how each of these inferences boils down to wanting to know whether some sentences are true or false. In example 1., we want to know whether the sentence "_It rains today_" is true or not. In example 2., the clinician wants to know which of the sentences "_The patient has pneumonia_", "_The patient has asthma_", "_The patient has bronchitis_", and so on, are true (several can be true at the same time). In example 5., the rocket engineer wants to know which among the sentences "_The velocity is\ \ $1.0\,\mathrm{m/s}$_", "_The velocity is\ \ $1.1\,\mathrm{m/s}$_", "_The velocity is\ \ $1.2\,\mathrm{m/s}$_", and so on, is true. The sentences that underlie an inference can be complex and can be extremely numerous, and yet they must be clear -- otherwise, do we really know what we're looking for?

The example inferences above present very different levels of difficulty.

Example inferences 3. and 5. are special because they can actually be made _exactly_. In example 3., we trivially see that putting the next [**X**]{style="color:#CA5556"} in the mid-right slot makes the X-player win. In example 5., a couple of mathematical operations give the approximate value $11\,\mathrm{km/s}$ for the velocity. When we can obtain  data we want from the data we have by using "only" logic and mathematical operations, we call the inference a _deduction_. We say "only" in quotation marks because the logical analysis and operations leading to the answer can still be computationally very expensive. But every deduction can be basically made by repeatedly applying the rules of logic.

The other example inferences cannot be made exactly, in the sense that we cannot get
