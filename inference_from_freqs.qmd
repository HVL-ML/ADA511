## If the population frequency were known {#sec-pop-freq-known}

Let's now see how the exchangeability of an agent's degrees of belief allows it to calculate probabilities about the units of a population. We shall do this calculation in two steps. First, in the case where *the agent knows the joint frequency distribution* (§§ [-@sec-freq-distr], [-@sec-joint-freq], [-@sec-limit-freqs]) *for the full population*. Second, in the more general case where the agent lacks this population-frequency information.

When the full-population frequency distribution is known, the calculation of probabilities is very intuitive and analogous to the stereotypical "drawing balls from an urn". We shall rely on this intuition; keep in mind, however, that the probabilities are not assigned "by intuition", but actually fully determined by the two basic pieces of knowledge or assumptions: *exchangeability* and *known population frequencies*. Some simple proof sketches of this will also be given.

## Notation {#sec-pop-inference-notation}

In this and the following chapters we shall stick to a particular use of some symbols, and shall often take the "adult income" dataset (file [`income_nominal_data_all.csv`](datasets/income_nominal_data_all.csv) as example.

We consider an infinite population with any number of variates. For concreteness we assume these variates to have finite, discrete domains; but the formulae we obtain can be easily generalized to other kinds of variates. *We shall denote all the population variates, jointly, with $\bZ$*. In the case of the income dataset, for instance, the variate $\bZ$ stands for the joint variate

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bZ &\defd (
\cat{workclass} \and 
\cat{education} \and 
\cat{marital_status} \and 
\cat{occupation} \and 
{}\\ &\qquad
\cat{relationship} \and
\cat{race} \and 
\cat{sex} \and 
\cat{native_country} \and 
\cat{income}
)
\end{aligned}
$$

\

In applications typical of "supervised learning" ([§ @sec-3-connection-ML]), the agent typically wants to draw inferences about *some* of the  $\bZ$ variates for a new unit, conditional on the values of the remaining variates.
