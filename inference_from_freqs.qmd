## If the population frequency were known {#sec-pop-freq-known}

Let's now see how the exchangeability of an agent's degrees of belief allows it to calculate probabilities about the units of a population. We shall do this calculation in two steps. First, in the case where *the agent knows the joint frequency distribution* (§§ [-@sec-freq-distr], [-@sec-joint-freq], [-@sec-limit-freqs]) *for the full population*. Second, in the more general case where the agent lacks this population-frequency information.
