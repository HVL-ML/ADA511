To solve *any* inference problem, or to design an AI agent for solving an inference problem, all we have to do in principle is to repeatedly use the [fundamental laws of inference of § @sec-fundamental].

In many cases an in-principle application of the inference laws is computationally impossible, however. Approximate calculations and premises are then used, which are sometimes quite drastic. The approximations used depend on the nature of the inference problem. This leads to many "recipes", which may look extremely different from one another, being used in specialized fields and applications. People working in those fields are trained to use those recipes.

Technological advances such as quantum computing may make the use of more powerful exact inference methods possible -- for those who know them.
:::

For a data-science engineer it is important to keep in mind that these recipes are only approximations, and that there are only a couple of principles underlying all of them, despite their diversity. The principled, maximally optimal solution should always be kept in sight. Technological advances continually allow us to make computations that were previously impossible -- think of "quantum computers" these days. A truly optimal in-principle solution, preferable to a sub-optimal approximation, can suddenly become accessible -- to those who know it!

\

We shall now introduce a very broad class of inference problems, then study the principled solution to it, and approximations to this solution.


## Induction

It is a fact of everyday experience that we expect things to happen in particular ways because of our previous experience with similar things. If we observe that ten electronic components in a row come out damaged from an assembly line, then we expect that the next one will be damaged as well. If you regularly go hiking in a particular area and often see deer, and sometimes hares, then you think it likely to see deer also at your next hike and, if you're lucky, a hare. You would probably be surprised to see a moose if you had never seen one in those areas. This doesn't only concern the future: if someone asks you whether you saw a deer during a hike from long time ago, which you don't quite remember anymore, you'd say "probably I did".

This familiar experience is called [*induction*](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/), especially in the philosophical literature. It has generated a lot of thought and research since the times of [Hume](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/) (18th century), who apparently was the first to ask how and why this experience is possible.

But this kind of regularities does not have clear-cut circumstances. In some cases it is not clear what should be considered "similar" things -- in fact, sometimes we circularly reverse the reasoning: if something does not respect an observed regularity then we say it wasn't "similar". Also the circumstances in which this regularity should occur are often not-well-defined: should you expect to see deer if you hike in a somewhat different area?

And sometimes this kind of regularities simply fails. Something expected doesn't happen any longer, even if the circumstances and the "similarity" are clearly the same. Jeffreys aptly said:

> [A common argument for induction is that induction has always worked in the past and therefore may be expected to hold in the future. It has been objected that this is itself an inductive argumentand cannot be used in support of induction. What is hardly ever mentioned is that induction has often failed in the past and that progress in science is very largely the consequence of direct attention to instances where the inductive method has led to incorrect predictions.]{.small}

### Induction and data science

Induction, with the mentioned caveats that accompany it, is at the basis of how we approach and solve many engineering problems, and at the heart of data science: from data about particular things or phenomena we try to infer new or old instances of "similar" things or phenomena.

We shall now see how this is done in a quantitative manner with the probability calculus. It is important to clarify what the probability calculus, and all approximate inference methods derived from it, can and cannot do:

- [{{< fa check >}} It allows us to make inductive inferences in a *quantitative* and guaranteed *self-consistent* way.]{.green}

- [{{< fa times >}} It does not *explain* why there are regularities and why induction in some cases works.]{.red}

- [{{< fa times >}} It does *not* tell us which things or phenomena should be considered "similar". In fact, what's similar and what's not is something that *we must input* into the probability calculus.]{.red}

- [{{< fa check >}} If we formulate the "similarity" and "non-similarity" of an instance as well-defined hypotheses, then the probability calculus allows us to calculate their probabilities (and make a decision as to accept, if necessary).]{.green}



## Inferences and populations {#sec-exchangeability}

Consider the following two sketches of inference problems, related to the scenarios of [§ @sec-collections]:

- Stock exchange
: In 100 days, the daily change in closing price of a stock has been `positive` 74 times, and `negative` 26 times, according a particular sequence; for instance:

    ![](stock.png){width=100%}

    In which of the subsequent 3 days will the closing-price change be positive, and in which negative?

:::{.column-margin}
![](stock_course.jpg){width=100%}
:::

\ 

- Mars prospecting
: Of the last 100 similar-sized rocks examined in a large crater on Mars, 74 contained hematite (`Y`), and 26 did not (`N`). For instance, the data could be:

    ![](rock.png){width=100%}

    Which, among the next 3 rocks that will be examined, will contain hematite, and which will be hematite-free?

<!--     2b. Assessing the failure status of the past 1100th electronic component from an assembly line, given the failure status of the last 1000 electronic components already out of the same assembly line. -->

\

Let us remember [chapter @sec-probability] that in order to set up and solve an inference problem we must first define appropriate *sentences* which we'll use in probability supposals and conditionals.

For the two problems above it looks obvious that we can use sentences involving the language of statistical populations. We must then try to define the units and the variates. *Tentatively* let's try the following definitions:

Stock exchange
: - *Units:* the problem is only sketched, so let's assume that a precise definition can be found somewhere. There are at least 100 + 3 units, but the problem suggests that we might consider an infinite population.
    - *Variates:* the change in closing price seems an obvious binary variate for the population. Let's denote it $\red C$, with domain $\set{\ypl,\ymi}$.


Mars prospecting
: - *Units:* again the problem is only sketched, so let's assume that a precise description exists of how the rocks to be examined should be chosen. There are at least 100 + 3 units, but the problem suggests that we might consider a practically infinite population.
    - *Variates:* the presence of hematite is an obvious binary variate. Let's denote it with $\red H$, with domain $\set{\yy,\yn}$.


The population data can be represented as follows, where question marks `?` indicate the units about which we want to draw inferences, and the ellipses "[...]{.midgrey}" indicate that the populations extend to possibly infinite other units.

## {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise
Would you define these two populations in a different way? Do you think other variates should be included, for example?
:::

With the representation above, 

















The two inference problems differ in some aspects and are similar in others. Time, for example, appears to be an important aspect of the first inference, which is in fact often categorized as a "[time-series analysis](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/understanding-statistics/statistical-terms-and-concepts/time-series-data)". But the second inference involves or could involve time as well: the rocks could be inspected sequentially. So more precisely it is the time *ordering* that is more relevant in the first inference than the second.


An important difference between the two inference problems is revealed by the following thought-experiments. Consider how you would answer in the stock-exchange case and in the Mars-prospecting case:

a. *It turns out that there was an error in the sequence of positive and negative datapoints, although not in the total amounts of positive and negative ones.* In the stock-exchange inference, for instance, days 1 ($-$) and 3 ($+$) were erroneously swapped, as were days 100 ($+$) and 85 ($-$), and many other days; in the Mars-prospecting inference, rocks #1 (Y) and #3 (N) were erroneously swapped, as were rocks #100 (Y) and #97 (N), and many other rocks.

    Should the final inference about the next 3 datapoints be changed?


b. *The information about the exact sequence of data is lost, and only the total amount of positive and negative datapoints is preserved* (74 vs 26).

    Would the final inference about the next 3 datapoints be different,  compared to the situation where the exact data sequence is known?


c. *A new inference is requested: not about the 3 datapoints following the known data, but the 3 datapoints preceding the known data*: the day before day 1 and so on, or the rock before rock #1 and so on. (Or, generalizing: an inference about 3 datapoints *interspersed* among the known ones is requested.)

    Would the inference for the preceding 3 datapoints be different from the original one about the subsequent 3 datapoints?

In all these thought-experiments, our intuition is that the inference for the stock-exchange problem would be different, but the one for the Mars-prospecting problem would stay the same or not change appreciably. Swapping days in a stock course, matters; swapping rocks in a crater, doesn't. There are good reasons, based on physics and dynamical-system theory, for this intuition.

An inference which does not change if data and unknown quantities are freely reordered, like the Mars-prospecting one, is called [**exchangeable**]{.blue}. Whereas an inference in which the ordering of data and unknowns is relevant, like the stock-exchange one, is called **non-exchangeable**. There is not a  dichotomy between the two cases; rather, there are continuous varying degrees of exchangeability or non-exchangeability. But for the moment we shall simplify this gradation into a binary distinction.

We shall now make this definition more precise, and then study and exploit the remarkable consequences that it has for an agent's inferences and probability calculations.


## Infinitely exchangeable probability distributions

### Definition

Consider a collection of quantities $X_1, X_2, X_3, \dotsc$, all having identical domains. For instance, they could all be continuous with values in the real numbers; or all binary, with values $\set{\cat{Yes}, \cat{No}q}$; or all ordinal, with values $\{\cat{low}, \cat{medium}, \cat{high}\}$; or all join quantities, with the same join domains. This collection is in principle infinite: it is always possible to add one more quantity, with the same domain, to the collection.

An agent has a joint probability distribution over them, conditional on some state of knowledge $\yI$:

$$
\P(X_1\mo x_1,\ X_2\mo x_2,\ X_3\mo x_3,\ \dotsc \| \yI)
$$

for all combinations of values $x_1, x_2, x_3, \dotsc$.


This joint probability distribution is called [**infinitely exchangeable**]{.blue} if [*all marginal probabilities ([§ @sec-marginal-probs]) for any sub-collection of quantities remain the same whenever the values are swapped among quantities*]{.blue}. For example:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&
\P(X_1 \mo \ya,\ X_2\mo \yb \| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\P(X_2 \mo \ya,\ X_1\mo \yb\| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\P(X_1 \mo \ya,\ X_3\mo \yb \| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\P(X_3 \mo \ya,\ X_1\mo \yb\| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\dotso
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\P(X_{23} \mo \ya,\ X_{7}\mo \yb\| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\dotso
\end{aligned}
$$

and so on, and also

$$
\begin{aligned}
&
\P(X_1 \mo \ya,\ X_2\mo \yb,\ X_3\mo \yc \| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\P(X_2 \mo \ya,\ X_1\mo \yb,\ X_3\mo \yc \| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\P(X_2 \mo \ya,\ X_3\mo \yb,\ X_1\mo \yc \| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\P(X_3 \mo \ya,\ X_4\mo \yb,\ X_5\mo \yc \| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\dotso
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\P(X_{12} \mo \ya,\ X_8\mo \yb,\ X_{47}\mo \yc \| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\dotso
\end{aligned}
$$

and also

$$
\begin{aligned}
&
\P(X_1 \mo \ya,\ X_2\mo \yb,\ X_3\mo \yc,\ X_4\mo \yd\| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\P(X_3 \mo \ya,\ X_4\mo \yb,\ X_2\mo \yc,\ X_1\mo \yd\| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\dotso
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\P(X_{91} \mo \ya,\ X_{72}\mo \yb,\ X_6\mo \yc,\ X_{13}\mo \yd\| \yI)
\\[1ex] {}={}&
\dotso
\end{aligned}
$$

and so on -- no matter how many and which quantities we take, and no matter what the values $\ya,\yb,\yc,\yd\dotsc$ might be.

In the following we shall simply call this type of probability distribution [**exchangeable**]{.blue}, omitting "infinitely". But keep in mind that there are also **finitely** exchangeable distributions, and *they have different properties*. Here, when we say "exchangeable", we always strictly mean "infinitely exchangeable".

:::{.callout-warning}
## {{< fa exclamation-circle >}}
Exchangeability does not mean that *all* probabilities need to be equal. For instance, if $\yb\ne\yc$ then these probabilities can be different:

$$\begin{gathered}
\P(X_1 \mo \ya,\ X_2\mo \yb \| \yI)
\mathrel{\boldsymbol{\ne}}
\P(X_1 \mo \ya,\ X_2\mo \yc \| \yI)
\\
\P(X_1 \mo \ya,\ X_2\mo \yb \| \yI)
\mathrel{\boldsymbol{\ne}}
\P(X_{23} \mo \ya,\ X_7\mo \yc \| \yI)
\end{gathered}$$

although we must still have

$$
\P(X_1 \mo \ya,\ X_2\mo \yc \| \yI)
\mathrel{\boldsymbol{=}}
\P(X_{23} \mo \ya,\ X_7\mo \yc \| \yI)
$$
:::

\

The definition of exchangeability given above can also be put in a different way. For an exchangeable probability distribution, the joint probability of a collection of quantities can only depend on the different values appearing in it and their multiplicities. For instance, the numerical value of the marginal, joint probability

$$
\P(X_{91} \mo \yb,\ X_{72}\mo \ya,\ X_6\mo \yb,\ X_{13}\mo \yc\| \yI)
$$

where $\ya,\yb,\yc$ are different from one another, can only depend on the fact that there are the three different values $\ya,\yb,\yc$, and that $\ya$ appears once, $\yb$ twice, and $\yc$ once. So any other marginal, joint probability containing the value $\ya$ once, $\yb$ twice, and $\yc$ once, must be equal to the one above.

\

For each of the marginal probabilities below, determine whether the joint probability they come from is *surely **non**-exchangeable*, and explain why. Note that we can't determine whether a probability distribution is exchangeable unless we're given *all* its probabilities, for all combinations of quantities and values.

Consider the collection of quantities $X_1, X_2, \dotsc$ with common domain consisting of three values $\set{\ylo,\yme,\yhi}$. The joint probability distribution for any set of these quantities is given by the function

$$
\P(X_i\mo x_i,\ X_j\mo x_j,\ \dotsc \| \yI) =
\frac{2\cdot \#\ylo!\cdot \#\yme!\cdot \#\yhi!}{(\#\ylo+\#\yme+\#\yhi+2)!}

The *factorial* $n!$ is defined by $n! \defd 1\cdot2\cdot\dotsb\cdot (n-1)\cdot n$, and $0!\defd 1$.
:::

where $\#\ylo$ is the number of times the value $\ylo$ appears among $x_i,x_j,\dotsc$, and similarly for $\#\yme$ and $\#\yhi$. For instance:

$$\begin{aligned}
\P(X_5\mo\yme,\ X_2\mo\yhi,\ X_{14}\mo\yme \|\yI) &=
\frac{2\cdot {\green0}!\cdot {\lblue2}!\cdot  {\yellow1}!}{({\green0} + {\lblue2} + {\yellow1} + 2)!}
\\[1ex]&=
\frac{2\cdot {\green1}\cdot
{\lblue2}\cdot
{\yellow1}}{5!}
\\&=
\frac{4}{120}
\\[1ex]&\approx 0.0333
\end{aligned}$$

Using the formula above, verify that the marginal probability distribution for two quantities $\P(X_1\mo x_1,\ X_2\mo x_2 \| \yI)$ satisfies

\P(X_1\mo x_1,\ X_2\mo x_2 \| \yI) = 1
$$

as it should (hint: you have to sum nine terms).
:::

Why are we focusing on exchangeable probability distributions? Because their mathematical properties have an interesting interpretation, very useful for particular kinds of inferences. We shall now explore this interpretation.





### Consequences

The stock-exchange and Mars-prospecting inference problems do not involve simple joint probabilities like

$$\P(X_{101}\mo x_{101},\ X_{102}\mo x_{102},\ \dotsc \| \yI)$$

but conditional probabilities like

$$\P(X_{101}\mo x_{101},\ X_{102}\mo x_{102},\ \dotsc \|
X_{100}\mo x_{100},\ X_{99}\mo x_{99},\ \dotsc,\ \yI)$$

because the problem is to infer some datapoints given other datapoints. What does exchangeability say about conditional probabilities?

It can be proved that

## Interpretations of exchangeability








Our focus, however, is not on the *whys* of this intuition, but on the consequences that it has for inference and probability calculations.
