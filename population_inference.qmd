To solve *any* inference problem, or to design an AI agent for solving an inference problem, all we have to do in principle is to repeatedly use the [fundamental laws of inference of § @sec-fundamental].

In many cases an in-principle application of the inference laws is computationally impossible, however. Approximate calculations and premises are then used, which are sometimes quite drastic. The approximations used depend on the nature of the inference problem. This leads to many "recipes", which may look extremely different from one another, being used in specialized fields and applications. People working in those fields are trained to use those recipes.

Technological advances such as quantum computing may make the use of more powerful exact inference methods possible -- for those who know them.
:::

For a data-science engineer it is important to keep in mind that these recipes are only approximations, and that there are only a couple of principles underlying all of them, despite their diversity. The principled, maximally optimal solution should always be kept in sight. Technological advances continually allow us to make computations that were previously impossible -- think of "quantum computers" these days. A truly optimal in-principle solution, preferable to a sub-optimal approximation, can suddenly become accessible -- to those who know it!

\

We shall now introduce a very broad class of inference problems. They include tasks performed by most common machine-learning algorithms: classification and regression, "supervised" and "unsupervised" learning, and similar. After studying the principled solution to this class of problems we'll discuss present-day approximations to it.


## Induction

It is a fact of everyday experience that we expect things to happen in particular ways because of our previous experience with similar things. If we observe that ten electronic components in a row come out damaged from an assembly line, then we expect that the next one will be damaged as well. If you regularly go hiking in a particular area and often see deer, and sometimes hares, then you think it likely to see deer also at your next hike and, if you're lucky, a hare. You would probably be surprised to see a moose if you had never seen one in those areas. This doesn't only concern the future: if someone asks you whether you saw a deer during a hike from long time ago, which you don't quite remember anymore, you'd say "probably I did".

This familiar experience is called [*induction*](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/), especially in the philosophical literature. It has generated a lot of thought and research since the times of [Hume](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/) (18th century), who apparently was the first to ask how and why this experience is possible.

But this kind of regularities does not have clear-cut circumstances. In some cases it is not clear what should be considered "similar" things -- in fact, sometimes we circularly reverse the reasoning: if something does not respect an observed regularity then we say it wasn't "similar". Also the circumstances in which this regularity should occur are often not-well-defined: should you expect to see deer if you hike in a somewhat different area?

And sometimes this kind of regularities simply fails. Something expected doesn't happen any longer, even if the circumstances and the "similarity" are clearly the same. Jeffreys aptly said:

> [A common argument for induction is that induction has always worked in the past and therefore may be expected to hold in the future. It has been objected that this is itself an inductive argumentand cannot be used in support of induction. What is hardly ever mentioned is that induction has often failed in the past and that progress in science is very largely the consequence of direct attention to instances where the inductive method has led to incorrect predictions.]{.small}

### Induction and data science

Induction, with the mentioned caveats that accompany it, is at the basis of how we approach and solve many engineering problems, and at the heart of data science: from data about particular things or phenomena we try to infer new or old instances of "similar" things or phenomena.

We shall now see how this is done in a quantitative manner with the probability calculus. It is important to clarify what the probability calculus, and all approximate inference methods derived from it, can and cannot do:

- [{{< fa check >}} It allows us to make inductive inferences in a *quantitative* and guaranteed *self-consistent* way.]{.green}

- [{{< fa times >}} It does not *explain* why there are regularities and why induction in some cases works.]{.red}

- [{{< fa times >}} It does *not* tell us which things or phenomena should be considered "similar". In fact, what's similar and what's not is something that *we must input* into the probability calculus.]{.red}

- [{{< fa check >}} If we formulate the "similarity" and "non-similarity" of an instance as well-defined hypotheses, then the probability calculus allows us to calculate their probabilities (and make a decision as to accept, if necessary).]{.green}



## Inferences and populations {#sec-two-populations}

### Stock exchange and Mars prospecting, again

Consider the following two sketches of inference problems, related to the scenarios of [§ @sec-collections]:

- Stock exchange
: In 100 days, the daily change in closing price of a stock has been `positive` 74 times, and `negative` 26 times, according a particular sequence; for instance:

    ![](stock.png){width=100%}

    In which of the subsequent 3 days will the closing-price change be positive, and in which negative?

:::{.column-margin}
![](stock_course.jpg){width=100%}
:::

\ 

- Mars prospecting
: Of the last 100 similar-sized rocks examined in a large crater on Mars, 74 contained hematite (`Y`), and 26 did not (`N`). For instance, the data could be:

    ![](rock.png){width=100%}

    Which, among the next 3 rocks that will be examined, will contain hematite, and which will be hematite-free?

Discuss:

- Which of the two inferences above seems more difficult?...

- ...Why? Speculate on which factors make one inference more difficult than the other.

- Which differences and similarities do you find between the two inferences?

- Which additional information could be important for drawing more precise inferences?

- Which type of quantities appear in the two inferences?

<!-- - Answer the same questions, considering two inference problems that are similar but "backwards in time": -->

<!--     1b. Assessing the value that a particular investment fund had in 3750 days ago, given the course of that fund in the past 3650 days. -->

<!--     2b. Assessing the failure status of the past 1100th electronic component from an assembly line, given the failure status of the last 1000 electronic components already out of the same assembly line. -->

### Translation into sentences

Let us remember [chapter @sec-probability] that in order to set up and solve an inference problem we must first define appropriate *sentences* which we'll use in probability supposals and conditionals.

For the two problems above it looks obvious that we can use sentences involving the language of statistical populations. We must then try to define the units and the variates. *Tentatively* let's try the following definitions:

Stock exchange
: - *Units:* the problem is only sketched, so let's assume that a precise definition can be found somewhere. There are at least 100 + 3 units, but the problem suggests that we might consider an infinite population.
    - *Variates:* the change in closing price seems an obvious binary variate for the population. Let's denote it $C$, with domain $\set{\ypl,\ymi}$.


Mars prospecting
: - *Units:* again the problem is only sketched, so let's assume that a precise description exists of how the rocks to be examined should be chosen. There are at least 100 + 3 units, but the problem suggests that we might consider a practically infinite population.
    - *Variates:* the presence of hematite is an obvious binary variate. Let's denote it with $H$, with domain $\set{\yy,\yn}$.


The population data can be represented as follows, where question marks **`?`** indicate the units about which we want to draw inferences, and the ellipses "[...]{.midgrey}" indicate that the populations possibly extend to infinite other units:

Would you define these two populations in a different way? Do you think other variates should be included, for example?
:::

### Desired probabilities

The stock-exchange  problem asks "In which of the subsequent 3 days will the closing-price change be positive, and in which negative?". In terms of the populations just introduced, this can be translated into:
\
\
"will the $C$ variate for units #101, #102, #103 have value $\ypl$ or $\ymi$?"

In other words, we are asking which of the two following mutually exclusive sentences, expressed symbolically, will be true:

$$
C_{101}\mo\ypl \qquad C_{101}\mo\ymi
$$

Since one of them must be true, their probabilities form a probability distribution ([§ @sec-prob-distribs]), in which for the moment we omit the conditional:

$$
\P\bigl(C_{101}\mo\ypl \|[\big]  \quad\quad
\P\bigl(C_{101}\mo\ymi \|[\big]
$$

Analogously for units #102 and #103, leading to two more probability distributions.

When we `and` together sentences for the three units we obtain a joint probability distribution ([§ @sec-prob-joint]) over 2³ = 8 mutually exclusive and exhaustive composite sentences:

$$\begin{aligned}
&\P\bigl(C_{101}\mo\ypl \and C_{102}\mo\ypl \and C_{103}\mo\ypl
\|[\big]
\\[1ex]
&\P\bigl(C_{101}\mo\ymi \and C_{102}\mo\ypl \and C_{103}\mo\ypl
\|[\big]
\\[1ex]
&\dotso
\\[1ex]
&\P\bigl(C_{101}\mo\ymi \and C_{102}\mo\ymi \and C_{103}\mo\ymi
\|[\big]
\end{aligned}$$

\

Now let's focus on the conditional. The information we are given consists of the values of the $C$ variate for units #1 to #100, which we can `and` together. We must  also `and` all other information implicit in the stock-exchange problem, which we denote $\yi[s]$:

$$
 \|[\big] C_{100}\mo\ypl \and C_{99}\mo\ypl \and \dotsc \and 
C_{3}\mo\ypl \and C_{2}\mo\ymi \and C_{1}\mo\ymi \and \yi[s] \bigr)
$$


We finally arrive at the eight probabilities (which constitute a probability distribution) that we want to calculate:

:::{.column-page-right}
$$\begin{aligned}
&\P\bigl(C_{101}\mo\ypl \and C_{102}\mo\ypl \and C_{103}\mo\ypl
\|[\big] C_{100}\mo\ypl \and C_{99}\mo\ypl \and \dotsc \and 
C_{3}\mo\ypl \and C_{2}\mo\ymi \and C_{1}\mo\ymi \and \yi[s] \bigr)
\\[1ex]
&\P\bigl(C_{101}\mo\ymi \and C_{102}\mo\ypl \and C_{103}\mo\ypl
\|[\big] C_{100}\mo\ypl \and C_{99}\mo\ypl \and \dotsc \and 
C_{3}\mo\ypl \and C_{2}\mo\ymi \and C_{1}\mo\ymi \and \yi[s] \bigr)
\\[1ex]
&\dotso
\\[1ex]
&\P\bigl(C_{101}\mo\ymi \and C_{102}\mo\ymi \and C_{103}\mo\ymi
\|[\big] C_{100}\mo\ypl \and C_{99}\mo\ypl \and \dotsc \and 
C_{3}\mo\ypl \and C_{2}\mo\ymi \and C_{1}\mo\ymi \and \yi[s] \bigr)
\end{aligned}$$

The next -- fundamental -- question is: how do we calculate these probabilities? Which other probabilities can we take as our starting point?
