## The difference between Probability Theory and Statistics

"Probability theory" and "statistics" are often mentioned together. We shall soon see why and what are the relationship between them. But first let's try to define them more precisely:

[**Probability theory**]{.blue}
: is the theory that describes and norms the quantification and propagation of uncertainty, as we saw in [§ @sec-probability-def].


[**Statistics**]{.blue}
: is the study of collective properties of the variates of populations or, more generally, of collections of data.

There are clear and crucial differences between the two:

- The fact that uncertain about something doesn't mean that there are populations or replicas involved. We can apply probability theory without doing any statistics.
- If we have full information about a population -- the value of the variate for each unit -- then we can calculate summaries and other properties of the variate. And there's no uncertainty involved: at all times we can exactly calculate any information we like about the variate. So we do statistics but probability theory plays no role (except perhaps in the form of propositional logic).


Many texts do not clearly distinguish between probability and statistics. The distinction is important for us because we will have to solve problems involving the *uncertainty* about particular *statistics*, so the two must be kept clearly separate. This distinction was observed by [James Clerk Maxwell](https://clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/html/about_maxwell.html) who used it to develop the theories of statistical mechanics and kinetic theory.

Maxwell explains the statistical method and its use in the molecular description of matter:

- [*Molecules*](https://hvl.instructure.com/courses/25074/modules/items/676285)

In many concrete problems, however, these do theories do go hand in hand and interact. This happens mainly in two non-mutually exclusive ways:

- the statistics of a population give information that can be used in the conditional of an inference
- we want to draw inferences about some statistics of a population, whose values we don't know.

Let's now discuss some important statistics.



## Frequency distribution

Consider a population with a variate $\yX$ having the finite set of $K$ values $\set{a_1, a_2, \dotsc, a_K}$ as domain. This variate could be of any non-continuous type: nominal, ordinal, interval, binary ([§ @sec-basic-types]), or of a joint or complex type ([§ @sec-data-types-multi]).
