## [THE FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF INFERENCE]{.underline style="text-align:center;"}

Rule for "not":
: $$\P(\lnot a \| D) 
+ \P(a \| D)
= 1$$ {#eq-not}

Rule for "and":
: $$
\P(a \land b \| D) 
= \P(a \| b \land D) \cdot
\P(b \| D) 
= \P(b \| a \land D) \cdot
\P(a \| D)
$$ {#eq-and}

Rule for "or":
: $$\P(a \lor b \| D) 
= \P(a \| D) +
\P(b \| D) 
- \P(a \land b \| D)
$$ {#eq-or}

Rule of self-consistency:
: $$\P(a \| a \land D) 
= 1
$$ {#eq-axiom}
