## Quantities

Most decisions and inferences in engineering and data science involve quantities or entities with some kind of mathematical properties: they can be expressed by a number or -- think of images or network graphs -- by collections of numbers. The sentences that appear in decision-making and inferences are therefore often of the kind "the quantity $X$ was measured to have value $x$". We commonly refer to these values as "data".

Data come in many different kinds, with different properties. Some statements only make sense with particular kinds of data. We therefore pay a quick visit to the data zoo, emphasizing aspects that are important for inference and decision-making.

We shall speak of [**quantities**]{.blue}, denoting them by letters such as $X$. A quantity has a value that must belong to a given set called the [**domain**]{.blue} of that quantity.

Examples of quantities:

- The distance between two objects (at a specific time). The domain could be, say, all values from $\mathrm{0\,m}$ to $\mathrm{6\cdot10^{12}\,m}$ ([Pluto](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/dwarf-planets/pluto)'s average orbital distance).

- The number of total views of some video (at a specific time), with a domain, say, from 0 to 20 billions.

- The force on an object (at a specific time and place). The domain could be, say, 3D vectors with three components in $[\mathrm{-100\,N},\,\mathrm{+100\,N}]$.

- The image taken by a camera. The domain could be all possible combinations of values in $[0,1]$ over three $1280\times 720$ grids (one grid per basic colour).

- The degree of satisfaction of a in a survey, with five possible values `Not at all satisfied`, `Slightly satisfied`, `Moderately satisfied`, `Very satisfied`, `Extremely satisfied`.

- The graph representing a social network, with domain consisting of all possible graphs with $0$ to $10000$ nodes and all possible combinations of links.

- A 1-minute audio track recorded by a device. The domain could be all possible combinations of 2 880 000 values in $[0,1]$ (sampling frequency of 48 kHz).

- The subject in an image, with domain of three possible values `cat`, `dog`, `something else`.

- The [roll, pitch, yaw](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/rocket/rotations.html) of a rocket (at a specific time and place), with domain $(-180°,+180°]\times(-90°,+90°]\times(-180°,+180°]$.

We take it for granted that a quantity does have one value, and one value only (even if the value itself can consist of, say, several numbers).


## Kinds of quantities

### Nominal

A [**nominal**]{.blue} or [**categorical**]{.blue} quantity has a domain with a discrete (usually finite) number of values. The values [*are not related by any mathematical property*]{.blue}, and [*do not have any specific order*]{.blue} (at least not a priori).

This means that it does not make sense to say, for instance, that some value is "twice" or "1.5 times" another, or "larger" or "later" than another one. Nor does it make sense to "add" two quantities. In particular, [*there is no notion of average for a nominal quantity*]{.blue}.

An example is the possible breeds of a dog, or the characters of a film.

It is of course possible to represent the values of a nominal quantity with numbers; say `1` for `Dachshund`, `2` for `Labrador`, `3` for `Dalmatian`, and so on. But that doesn't mean that "`Dalmatian`${}-{}$`Labrador`${}={}$`Labrador`${}-{}$`Dachshund`" or similar nonsense.



### Ordinal

An [**ordinal**]{.blue} quantity has a domain with a discrete (usually finite) number of values. The values [*are not related by any mathematical property*]{.blue}, but [*do have a specific order*]{.blue}.

This means that it does not make sense to say that some value is "twice" or "1.5 times" another, and we cannot "add" two values. But it does make sense to say, for any two values, which one has higher rank; for example "stronger", or "later", and similar. Also in this case [*there is no notion of average for an ordinal quantity*]{.blue}.

An example would be a [pain-intensity scale](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2004.08.007): a patient can say whether a pain is stronger than another, but it isn't clear what a pain "twice as strong" as another would mean (although there's a lot of research on trying to quantify pain more precisely). Another example could be the "strength of friendship" in a social network: we can say that we have a  "stronger friendship" with a person than with another; but it doesn't make sense to say that we are "four times stronger friends".

Also for ordinal quantities it is possible to represent the values with numbers. In this case the numbers can reflect the *order* of the values. But it's important to keep in mind that differences or averages of such numbers wouldn't make sense. Unfortunately the use of numbers can be deceptive in this regard. A less deceptive possibility is to represent ordered values by alphabet letters, for example.

### Binary

A [**binary**]{.blue} or [**dichotomous**]{.blue} quantity has only two possible values. Although it is really a special case of a nominal or ordinal quantity, the fact of having only two values lends it some special properties in inference problems. This is why we list it separately from others.

Obviously it doesn't make much sense to speak of the difference or average of the two values; and their ranking is trivial even if it makes sense.

There's an abundance of examples of binary quantities: yes/no answers, presence/absence of something, and so on.

### Interval

An [**interval**]{.blue} quantity has a domain that can be discrete or continuous. The values [*do admit some mathematical operations*]{.blue}, at least *convex combination* and *subtraction*. They also admit an ordering.

This means that we can say whether the interval or "distance" between a pair of values is the same, or larger, or smaller than the interval between another pair. For this reason we can also say whether a value is larger than another. We can also take the *convex combination* of several values, which means we can take a weighted sum of them. Note that simple *addition* of values may still be meaningless, though.

Owing to these mathematical properties, [**it does make sense to speak of the average for an interval quantity**]{.blue}.

The number of electronic components produced in a year by an assembly line is an example of a discrete interval quantity. The power output of a nuclear plant at a given time is an example of a continuous one.

It is also possible to speak of *ratio* quantities, which are a special case of interval quantities, but we won't have use of this distinction in the present notes.

### Other complex kinds

The kinds of quantities listed so far are all, in a certain sense,  one-dimensional.

Some complex quantities are simply collections of quantities of the kinds listed above, so their analysis and their main properties reduces somehow to the ones already discussed.

But there are many quantities whose sets of possible values have particular mathematical properties and operations that cannot be obtained by simply gathering together quantities of a one-dimensional kind.
Examples are quantities related to colours, images, audio, video, graphs. For such kinds of complex quantities it is often important to be able to say whether two values are "close" to each other or "far away". This leads to the introduction of *metrics* and other mathematical structures on the sets of values. The metrics may also depend on the particular purpose the quantity is used for.

Some of these kinds of complex quantities will be discussed on a case-by-case basis.
